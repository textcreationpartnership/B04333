            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>READER,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAving well weighed and conſidered with mature Deliberation, that a Work of this nature cannot but be grateful to my Country, I have the more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to bring it to the higheſt Pitch of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, ſupplying what has been omitted by others, who have with ſome Diligence and Induſtry attempted to compile a compleat Body of Agriculture; or to lay down ſuch material things, as might redound to the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the Knowledge of the Ingenious Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman, to make his Charge and Labour an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer his Expectation, but have, in many mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, upon Experience, come ſhort of what was, no doubt, well meant, becauſe moſt of them had not practiſed what they writ, but
<pb facs="tcp:174183:5"/>
were obliged to borrow them from others, and take them on Truſt, and many of them from Foreign Authors; not well conſidering, that differing Climates produce different Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, though things are managed one and the ſame way: For what the Ground in one Country will kindly produce, that in another, through too much Heat, Cold, or Moiſture, will not, though the Soil be much of the like Temper; in which, were it not for Brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's ſake, I could give many convincing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,</p>
            <p>Theſe things, I ſay, conſider'd, I have grounded this Work upon long Experience, and truly proved to my great Advantage whatever I have laid down; which I have done in as eaſie a Method, and as practicable as can be; and, as I think, have omitted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is proper for ſuch a Treatiſe. I have given you the proper Manures, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſeveral ſorts of Lands, and the true way of improving them from little or no Value to great Advantage. Alſo an exact Method for draining all ſorts of Land, and for floating it, as occaſion requires; with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of Tools, and proper Engins for the Work and Management: The beſt Methods for Ploughing and Sowing, the laying of Land, and the diſtributing of Grain, and every thing elſe that is neceſſary, from its ſpringing up, till it is ſold and delivered in the Market. To which I have ſubjoined many other rare
<pb facs="tcp:174183:5"/>
and profitable Improvements of Barren Land, known to few, and practiſed by leſs; becauſe ſome have already been diſcouraged herein, for want of well-grounded Notions to further them in the true Experiment; it being too much the Nature of Engliſh-men, in matters of expected Profit, to be too ſoon diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, if things at firſt fail to ſucceed to their Wiſh.</p>
            <p>I have further conſidered every thing that is uſeful relating to Wood-lands, or Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Lands to a vaſt Value, by ſetting Trees, with all the Meaſures of ordering them; and laid down many convincing Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for the promoting of Incloſures, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Objections of Commoners, and others, who oppoſe it, to their own great Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, out of Obſtinacy or fooliſh Cuſtom, when by this means vaſt numbers of poor People might be ſet on work at preſent, and for the future be well maintained, if not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched by the Advantage ariſing thereby.</p>
            <p>And, to make this Work more compleat, I have added an Almanack, containing Progno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks of Weather, Seaſons, Obſervations of the Year from Critical Days, and what is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in many Particulars to be obſerved in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Month, as well in Affairs, as to keep and order the Body, and to continue it in a health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Temper, and for Seven Years to come. Among ſundry other things, too tedious here to mention, I have ſet down the exact
<pb facs="tcp:174183:6"/>
Fallings out of the Movable Feſtivals, and when the Movable Terms begin and end. So that, I conceive, I have laboured to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and therefore cannot but reaſonably hope this Work will find Acceptance. In expectation whereof, that I may be the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther encouraged to do for the publick Good, I am, kind Reader,</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Excellency, Neceſſity, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs of the Advancement of Good Husbandry.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Excellency of Huſbandry appeareth partly by its Antiquity, as we eſteem Things to be the more Admirable, the more Ancient, and the nearer they come to God, the Firſt Being of all Beings; for as all Things nearer the Centre move more ſtrongly, ſo all Excellency appears moſt evidently the nearer (if I may ſpeak with Reverence) to the Great Majeſty, the Almighty Huſbandiſer, God himſelf. Firſt, in his Making the World: He made all Creatures, all Plants, Fruits, Trees, Herbs, and all Things bearing Seed for the Food of Man and Beaſt; God alſo made theſe moſt Excellent and Glorious Creatures, as the Light, the Day, the Firmament, the Earth, and Seas, the Sun, Moon, and Stars, all to be Serviceable, and Miniſters to the Creatures Relief, and all the Creatures ſubſervient to Man,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:174183:11"/>
and Man to Overlook, Cheriſh, and Improve the Fruits of the Earth, and Dreſs and Keep them for the Uſe of the whole Creation. So that God was the Original and Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of all Huſbandry, and Firſt Contriver of the Great Deſign, to bring that odd Maſs, and Chaos of Confuſion, unto ſo vaſt an Improvement, as all the World admires and ſubſiſts on: And having given Man ſuch a Pattern, both for Precept and Precedent for his Encouragement, he made him Lord of all until he fell; and after that, God intended the Preſervation of what he made, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Great Curſe upon <hi>Adam, Eve,</hi> and the <hi>Serpent,</hi> the Earth not being free from it, but a Curſe of Barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs caſt upon it alſo, yet <hi>Adam</hi> was ſent forth to Till the Earth, and Improved it, in the Sweat of his Face he muſt eat Bread, until he return to the Earth again; and ſo down to <hi>Abel,</hi> the one Husbanding the Earth for Tillage, and the other the Sheep in Paſturing and Grazing; and ſo down to <hi>Noah,</hi> the firſt Planter of the Vine, he began to be an Husbandman; and to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to <hi>Jacob,</hi> and to <hi>Eſau,</hi> and ſo along from the Patriarchs, till they came to the Government of Kings, where <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi>'s Commendation was, <hi>That he loved Husbandry,</hi> 2 Chron. 26.11. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny excellent Things, as if Husbandry were moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, as indeed it is, here on Earth, where <hi>Solomon,</hi> the Wiſeſt Man, was the Second Husbandman, or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover of the World, whom you ſhall find, out of the Depth of his Experience, to cry up Diligence and Activity in good Husbandry, and therefore he ſendeth us to the Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, declaiming againſt the Sluggard and Slothful, <hi>On whom,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>cometh poverty as an armed man.</hi> He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tols the Diligent, as fitteſt to Converſe with Kings, when the Idle ſhall be under Tribute. For the Uſefulneſs of it, it is no leſs than the Maintenance of our Lives, Eſtates, the Common-wealth, and an Advancement and Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Fruits and Profits of the Earth by Ingenuity, is little leſs than an Addition of a New World; for what is gained hereby, either above the Natural Fruitfulneſs of the Earth, or elſe by Reducement of that which is Deſtroyed, or Impoveriſhed from its Natural Fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to a greater Fertility, is a clear Argumentation and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:174183:11"/>
Addition to the Honour and Profit of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation: All other Callings but proceeding hence, the Earth being the very Womb that bears all, and the Mother that muſt nouriſh and maintain all. The Merchant is a gallant Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to the Common-wealth, he fetches his Riches from far, and he is a worthy Contributer to the Wealth and Proſperity of the Kingdom; but he produceth it from others, who could themſelves make great Profit of it, and though he gaineth a great Eſtate, yet he raiſeth it not out of nothing, but parts with Gold and Silver, and with Commodities for it: But this Merchant of Husbandry, he raiſeth it out of the Earth, which otherwiſe would yield little, unleſs his Ingenuity digged and ſethed it out; otherwiſe, poſſibly it had never been ſo diſcovered, as to have been there. And what parts he with for it? What Rates purchaſeth he it at? Even only by his ingenuous Induſtry, and with the Wages of the Labouring Man, whom he is bound both by the Laws of God and Nature, to allow a Competent Maintenance. Oh, the Excellency, Integrity, and Uſe of Husbandry; <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.26. <hi>A bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing is on the head of him that tilleth corn, and the thoughts of the diligent bring abundance.</hi> To conclude with few words: As for the Terms of Husbandry, I reſolved to deliver my ſelf in our own Native Country's ordinary and home-ſpun Language, not ſlighting thoſe ancient Terms which are uſed in ſeveral Countries, the better to acquaint my Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with them; all which I ſhall do as briefly as poſſibly I may, to render my ſelf acceptable to my Reader's clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Apprehenſion.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>How to know the Goodneſs of the Ground.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MAny count that to be the beſt Ground, that lieth at the foot of a Hill, being level, and towards the Sun, in Cold and Northerly Countries, it is good to have the Land to be Eaſt and South, leaſt theſe two Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, being hard off by an Hill, the Land be frozen with Cold: but in hot Countries, it is better to have the Ground lie North, both for Pleaſure and Health. You may ſooner know the Conditions of every Ground, than of Men them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; for the Ground being well Tilled, can hardly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you. To know the Nature therefore of every Ground, you muſt mark well the Plants, and the Yield of the Country, except you will loſe your Labour, look whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be in the Land, either Stone, Marble, Sand, Gravel, Raddel, Chalk, Clay, Prebile, or Carbuncle, that is, Ground over-heated and parched with the Sun, which will burn the Roots of whatſoever cometh in it. Alſo, if it be wet or weeping Ground, or ſubject to ſuch other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, and ſuch Ground alſo, according to the Natures of the Soyl, is good or evil. In ſome Countries Stone Ground is altogether barren, eſpecially for Corn and Fruit: in other Places again, they uſe Stones in the Manuring and Bettering of their Ground. In ſome places, in ſtony and hilly Ground, Oats do proſper well. In like manner alſo, in all Countries, you muſt regard the Layre of the Country, and the Nature of the Seed that we ſow: for Gravel in ſome places is caſt upon the Ground, inſtead of Dung, and ſome Things proſper beſt in Gravelly Ground. It is alſo ſomething to the purpoſe, whether the Gravel be White, Red, or Yellow: beſides, pure Ground doth deceive both with Colour and Quality. In ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries the black Mould is only eſteemed: in others, the fat red Mould is thought beſt. In other places the chalky Ground beareth good Corn, and Paſtures very well. In ſome

places the thick and clammy Ground is moſt fruitful; in all theſe it is to be learned, what is beſt for the hilly Ground, what for the Valley, what for the Tilled, what for the Lay Ground, what the moſt Sedgy Ground requires, and what the Dry and Barren. Alſo in Planting, what Ground is beſt for Vines, what for other Trees; what delights in dry Ground, and what in moiſt Ground. <hi>Virgil</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth a Ground that is fat; for ſuch Ground is Tilled with ſmalleſt Charge and Labour: the next, that which is fat and ſtiff, which greatly recompenſeth the Huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Travail and Charges: the worſt, is, that which is dry, lean, and ſtiff; for it is not only Tilled with great pains, but alſo, it doth not anſwer the Huſbandman's Expectation in his Crop, neither at any time ſerveth it for good Meadow, or Paſture, and therefore ſuch Ground is not to be medled withal.

You muſt take Notice that Ground will alſo change, and of fruitful become barren; which hath been ſeen in ſeveral places of our Country. Beſides, one kind of Ground, though it be never ſo fertile, will not bear all things. Moreover, the Diſpoſition of the Heavens is a great matter, all Countries have not the Weather and Air alike; wherefore, it is the part of a good Huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, to know the Nature and Properties of his Ground, and to mark the Diſpoſition of it for every Seaſon of the Year: he muſt alſo conſider, what Crop is beſt for every Layer.

                  <p> Of the Dunging of Ground.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SInce in all places the Ground is not of a like good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, if we chance upon a lean, and a barren Ground, as heathy, bruſhy, and gravelly Ground, we muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to make theſe fruitful, and to mend them by Art; for there is no Country that our moſt Gracious GOD hath left without ſufficient Yield, if we uſe but our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, which may be happily employed divers ways, principally by Dunging, and diligent Labour. To which purpoſe, it will be neceſſary for us to know, what Dung doth moſt enrich the Earth: The moſt Expert of the Ancient Huſbandmen, appoint three ſorts of Dungs: the firſt of Poultry, the next of Men, the third of Cattel. Of the firſt ſort, the beſt is had out of Dove-Houſes; the next is of Pulline, and other Fowl, except Geeſe and Ducks, which is hurtful. The Ancients had ſuch ſtore of Poultry and Fowl, as the Dung of them is ſaid to have ſufficed for the Manuring of their Ground. The next to this, is Man's Ordure, if it be mixt with other Rubbiſh of the Houſe: for of itſelf it is too hot, and burns the Ground. Man's Urine, being kept ſix Months, and poured upon the Roots of Apple-trees, and Vines, cauſeth them to be very fruitful, and giveth a pleaſant Taſte to the Fruit. In the third place, is the Dung of Cattel, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the beſt is the Dung of Aſſes, becauſe this Beaſt doth chew with the moſt leiſure, whereby his Meat being well digeſted, is made the profitabler Dung. Next to this, is, the Dung of Sheep, next of Goats, then of Oxen, and Horſes. The worſt of Swine, very hurtful to the Corn, but uſed in ſome Places for Gardens, for want of other Dung, it is a great Breeder of noyſom Weeds. The Dung of Horſes likewiſe, where they are fed with Barley, doth breed Weeds. The Lupine, before he bear his God, is moſt commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, being turned up with the Plough or Mattock, and laid in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:174183:14"/>
Bundles about the Roots of Trees or Vines. Where they have no ſtore of Cattel, they uſe to mend their Ground with Straw and Fern, and with the Stalks of Lupines, and the Branches laid together in ſome Ditch: hereunto you may caſt Aſhes, the Filth of Sinks and Privies, Straw, and other things raked together: but in the midſt you muſt lay ſome ſound Subſtance, againſt the Breeding of Adders and Snakes: alſo Hemlocks, Walwort, and the Weeds growing about Willow-Trees, and Fern, with other ſuch rotten Weeds, you may gather and lay under your Sheep. They that dwell in gravelly and heathy Grounds, do take the Turns of the Earth and Heath, and laying them in Heaps, poudred with a little Dung, ſuffer them to lie and rot, and after lay it on barren Ground, but more eſpecially when they keep great ſtore of Sheep, they caſt into their Folds ſuch Turns pared from the Ground; <hi>Columella</hi> counts them but bad Huſbands, that have of every one of the leſſer kind of Cattel, leſs than a Cartload of Dung in Three hundred Days, and each of the greater ſort ten Load, beſides the Filth and Dirt of the Yard. This is alſo to be taken Notice of, that the Dung that hath lain a Year, is beſt for the Corn, for it both is of ſufficient ſtrength, and breedeth leſs Weeds; but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Meadow and Paſture, you muſt lay the neweſt, becauſe it brings moſt Graſs; and this muſt be done in <hi>February,</hi> the Moon encreaſing; for this is the beſt time to cauſe increaſe of Graſs.</p>
               <p>In the Manuring of your Ground, look that you lay moſt Dung upon the top of the Hill, for the Rain will drive it into the lower parts faſt enough.</p>
               <p>He that intends to have his Ground to bear much Corn, if he mean to Sowe in the end of the Summer, muſt turn in his Dung in <hi>September;</hi> if in the Spring, he may lay it on in any time of the Winter. What time ſoever he doth it, he muſt look that the Wind he Weſterly, and the Moon in the Wayne. Beſides, he muſt be ſure, that the Dung be dry when he lays it on the Ground; for laying it on while it is moiſt, it doth more harm to the Ground than good, as daily Experience teacheth. Now as the Land will wax cold, if it be not Dunged, ſo will it be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:174183:14"/>
dried or burnt, if it be Manured yearly, or too much. The watry Ground requireth more ſtore of Dung, and the dry Ground the leſs.</p>
               <p>In ſome places, the Scouring of Ponds and Ditches is uſed, to the great enriching of the Ground; in moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous and barren Lands, they make their Land fruitful with laying on of Chalk; but long uſe of it makes the Ground ſtark nought: from whence it is grown a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Saying, <hi>That Ground enriched with Chalk, makes a rich Father, and a beggarly Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The River-Land, by overflowing, and faſt Ground with muddy, mingled with Sand and Gravel, will do very well.</p>

                  <p> The Nature, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe, and Benefit of Marl.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE <hi>Germans,</hi> beſides other ſorts of Enriching their Grounds, do, in ſome places, inſtead of Dung, caſt upon it a kind of a Pitch and Fatneſs of the Earth, (<hi>Pliny</hi> would have it to be firſt deviſed in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France</hi>) called, <hi>Marga,</hi> as it were, the Fat of the Earth: it is gotten in deep Pits, but not alike in all Soyls. Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionleſs, Marle is a very uſeful thing, the Nature of it cold; which is the Reaſon that it ſaddens the Land ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly; and very heavy it is, and will go down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>Some Countries yield Marle of ſeveral Colours, as 'tis affirmed of <hi>Kent,</hi> where 'tis found both Yellow, Grey, Blew, and Red; the Blew and Grey are counted the beſt: for to Marle together, I hold not prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r; but when you reſolve to lay down your Land to Graze, be ſure at the laſt Crop you intend to take, (which may be two or three more after Marling) then Manure your Land with Dung, which will open, lighten, and looſen the Land: for the leſs binding, and the more light, looſe, and open, the more fruitful it is, ſo that it will produce a gallant Clovery.

The firſt Year after you have laid it down upon the Wheat, or mixed Corn-ſtubble, you ſhould run it over again with Dung, and it will pay treble.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p> Of Ploughing, the Parts of the Plough, and the best Seaſon for Ploughing.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IN Ploughing and Ordering, and right Preparing the Ground for Seed, conſiſts the chiefeſt Point of Huſban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry. The moſt Experienced affirm, That the firſt Point of Huſbandry, is to Prepare the Ground; the ſecond, to Plough it well; and the third, to Dung it well. The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions are divers, according to the Nature of every Soyl and Country. All great Fields are Tilled with the Plough and Share, the leſſer with the Spade.</p>
               <p>The Ploughs, ſome are ſingle, ſome double, of ſundry Faſhions, according to the diverſity of the Countries; ſome are with Wheels, ſome without.</p>
               <p>The Parts of the Plough are, the Tail, the Shelf, the Beam, the Foot, the Coulter, the Share, the Wheels, and the Staff. The Share is that which firſt cuts the way for the Coulter, that afterwards turns up the Furrow, where the Ground is light, they uſe only a ſmall Share.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Liffland,</hi> they have for their Plough, nothing but a Fork. In <hi>Syria,</hi> where they cannot go very deep, they uſe (as <hi>Theophraſtus</hi> ſaith) very little Ploughs. <hi>Pliny</hi> writes, that Wheels for Ploughs were deviſed by the <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> and called <hi>Plugrat,</hi> a <hi>German</hi> Name, which is corruptly printed <hi>Planarati.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:174183:15"/>In divers places where the Ground is ſtiff, they have a little Wing on the right ſide of the Coulter, which Wing is to be removed to which ſide you liſt. with the Rod or Staff, well pointed, the Plough-man maketh clean his Coulter, when he works.</p>
               <p>The Oxen muſt be yoaked even together, that they may draw the more handſomely, with their Heads at liberty, that their Necks may not be hurt. This kind of Yoaking is better liked of many, than to be yoaked by the Horns: for the Cattel ſhall be able to draw better with the Neck and the Breaſt, than they ſhall be with their Heads: and this way they put too the force of their whole Bodies, whereas the other way (being reſtrained by the Yoak, and their Heads) they are ſo vexed and hindred, as that they can ſcarcely race the upper part of the Earth.</p>
               <p>Where Horſes may be uſed, they are more commodious for the Plough, and the fewer of them the better: for many Horſes draw too haſtily, and make too large Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, which is not good: whereas we ſee the Ground to be excellently well ploughed in <hi>Gelderland,</hi> and about <hi>Cologne,</hi> where they plough only with two Horſes, going very ſoftly.</p>
               <p>In <hi>France,</hi> and other places, where they plough with Oxen, they make their Furrows rather deep than broad. Where the Ground is ſtiff, the Coulter muſt be the greater and the ſtronger, that it may go the deeper: for if the Cruſt of the Earth be turned up very broad, it remaineth ſtill whole, whereby neither the Weeds are killed, nor the Ground can be well harrowed. The Furrow ought not to exceed One hundred and twenty foot in length; for if it do, as ſome hold, it is hurtful to the Beaſts, becauſe it will be too weariſome to them: but this Rule is not obſerved, as in the Countries where the Fields are great, their Furrows are drawn very long.</p>
               <p>You muſt not plough in wet Ground, nor when after a long Drought, a little Rain falling, hath but wet the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per part, and not gone deep. If it be too wet when it is ploughed, it will do little good that Year, you muſt therefore obſerve, that the Seaſon be neither too dry,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:174183:16"/>
nor too wet: for too much drineſs cauſeth it, that it will never work well; for either the hardneſs of the Earth will reſiſt the Plough, or if it does enter, it breaks it not ſmall enough, but only turneth up great Flakes hurtful to the next Ploughing. For though the Land be never ſo rich, yet if you go any depth, it will prove barren, which is turned up with great Clods, from whence it proceeds, that the bad Mould mixt with the good, yieldeth the worſer Corn.</p>
               <p>Where you have ploughed in a dry Seaſon, it will be convenient for you to have ſome moiſture in your ſecond ſtirring, which moiſtning the Ground, ſhall make your Labour the eaſier. When the Ground is rich, and hath long born Water, it is to be ſtirred when the Weather is warmer, and when the Weeds are full grown, and have their Seeds in their top, which being ploughed ſo thick, as you can ſcarce ſee where the Coulter hath gone, utterly killeth and deſtroyeth the Weeds: beſides, through many ſtirrings, your Fallow is brought to ſo fine a Mould, as that it ſhall need little or no Harrowing, when you Sowe it: for the old <hi>Romans,</hi> as <hi>Calumella</hi> affirms, would ſay, That the Ground was ill huſbanded, that after Sowing had need of the Harrow.</p>
               <p>Moreover, the good Huſbandman muſt try whether it be well ploughed or not, and not only to truſt to his Eyes, but to Experience with his hand, (otherwiſe the Balkes being covered with Mould) he may eaſily be deceived, ſo that he muſt be upon certain proof; to which purpoſe, let him thruſt down a Rod into the Furrow, which if it pierce alike in every place, it ſheweth that the Ground is well ploughed. If it be ſhallow in one place, and deep in another place, it ſignifies that the Ground was not well ploughed.</p>
               <p>If you are to plough upon a Hill, you muſt plough over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thwart, and not up and down: for thereby the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency of the ſteepneſs is met withal, and the Labour both of the Men and Cattel is eaſed; but herein you muſt be careful, that you plough not always one way, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times higher, ſometimes lower, working aſlope as you ſhall ſee cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:174183:16"/>Touching the Seaſon of Ploughing, it muſt be chiefly in the Spring; for in Summer the Ground is too hard, and in Winter too foul and dirty; but in the Spring, the Ground being mellow, is eaſily to be wrought, and the Weeds are then but turned in, which both does good for the Inrichment of the Ground; and plucked up by the Roots before they have ſeeded, will ſpring again: and therefore, for the moſt part, we begin to plough about the midſt of <hi>March;</hi> but ſandy and light Grounds, they uſe to be ploughed in the midſt of Winter, if the Seaſon will ſuffer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pliny</hi> is of my Opinion, that ſtiff Ground then ſhould be ſtirred.</p>
               <p>A ſlender and level Ground, ſubject to Water, ſhould be firſt ploughed in the end of <hi>August,</hi> and ſtirred again in <hi>September,</hi> and prepared for Sowing about the twelfth of <hi>March.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The light hilly Ground is not to be broken up in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, but about the middle of <hi>September:</hi> for if it be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up before, being barren, and without Juyce, it may be burnt up with the Sun, and have no goodneſs remain in it.</p>
               <p>Wet Ground, ſome would have to be broken up after the Ides, or beginning of <hi>April,</hi> which being ploughed that time, ſhould be ſtirred about the tenth of <hi>June,</hi> and after again. But thoſe that are ſkilful in Husbandry agree, that in the tenth of <hi>June,</hi> without great ſtore of Rain, you ſhall not plough; for if the Year be wet, I know nothing to the contrary, but that you may plough in <hi>July.</hi> In the mean time be very careful, that you meddle not with Ground that is over-wet.</p>

                  <p> Of Liming, Sanding, and Hacking Land, to make it fruitful.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THere are other Conſiderations relating to the well Ordering of Ground, than what I have already touch'd on, to clear and prepare them for Corn, Graſs, Pulſe, or other Things, uſeful and exceeding profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table:</p>
               <p>If the Ground be barren, cold, or produces Weeds or Ruſhes, to help it, and bring it to a moderate Temper of Improvement for Fruitfulneſs, Lime is exceeding good. The Lime-ſtones may be got among Quarries of Stones, and in divers other places you may burn them in a Kiln, in the moſt convenient place you have, to ſave Charges of Carriage, and when you have before ſanded your Ground, and hacked it, make your Lime ſmall, and on every Acre beſtow between thirty and forty Buſhels of Lime, ſpreading and mixing it exceeding well with the Sand and Earth, and the ſtronger and ſharper the Lime is, the better the Earth will be, and the Improvement will anſwer your Coſt and Labour.</p>
               <p>It matters not, of what Colour your Lime-ſtones are, whether of a pure White, or of a Grey, ſo they be ſharp and ſtrong in quality, to give a good Tincture to the Earth, it being the Strength and Goodneſs of the Lime, not the Beauty, that in this kind brings forth the Profit; and, indeed, it is a great Helper to Cold Grounds, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Clay, or Wet Grounds; and this is a great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parer to laying Dung on theſe Lands, or any Soyl that is fatning, either of Cattel, or ſuch as is caſt out of Ponds, Lakes, or muddy Ditches, for barren and hard Earth can never be overlaid with good Manure, or Compoſt, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the want of Warmth and Fatneſs which theſe produce, was before the occaſion of the Unfruitfulneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:174183:17"/>As for the Hacking and Sanding mentioned, the firſt is, after the Ground has been turned up with the Plough, to go over it with a long Hoe, or Hack, and cut in pieces the Graſs that you ſee turned up in the Ridges, or Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, or any uneven Clumpers, that it may be dragged away, burnt, or carried together with the Weeds, not to grow up again to incumber the Corn, or Pulſe; and Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is to bring Loads of Sand, lay them in convenient places, as Heaps of Dung, and ſpread them lightly, or thick, as you ſee occaſion, over the Ground, that the Lime mixing with it, may the better Embody with the Mould, and Rain falling, be ſoaked in a good depth, to the heartning the Ground, and producing a good Crop to encourage the induſtrious Farmer.</p>

               <p>AS to the firſt manner of Ploughing of Ground that is barren, for the Improvement of it, if it lie free from Water, as commonly all even barren Earths do, then throw down the Furrows flat, and between every of them leave a little Baulk, about half the breadth of the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and ſo go thorough and plough up the whole, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard to Difference or Diſtinction of Lands; but if there be danger of Annoyance of Water, lay the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows more near and high, dividing the Ground into ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Lands, proportioning each of them to lie higheſt in the middle, that the Water deſcending may have free paſſage on either ſide; and when you have Hacked, Sanded, and Limed it, as before directed, come to your Second Plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

not ſtirred, make your Furrows deeper and greater, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them cloſer and rounder together: and in this Order, or Latter Earing, be ſedulous to plough it as clean as may be, leaving no Baulks, or any Eſcapes; and as you plough, have thoſe that ſhall follow, to run it over with a Second Hacking; that is, with a heavy Share, Hoe, or Hack, to clear, or kill the Graſs and Weeds, as alſo to lay it level.</p>
               <p>This done, take a Pair of ſtrong Iron-teethed Harrows, and go over the Ground, to open and tare that which was ploughed and hacked into ſmaller Particles, and raiſe the Mould lightly in greater abundance. Then take the beſt ſort of that Grain you think fit to Sowe in it, and ſcatter it according to the Art of good Huſbandry, ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Sprinkling to be a Medium, not too much nor too little.</p>
               <p>The Seed being ſprinkled on the Ground, make your Second Harrowing to cover it cloſe and well, being careful to break all the Clots as near as poſſible, raiſing the Mould as fine and high as may be, that it may cover the Seed the deeper, and prevent the Rain waſhing it up, or the Birds, and other Vermine, from deſtroying it; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that theſe cold, clayey, or barren Grounds, if not lightly raiſed, keep in and clog the Seed, which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of its roughneſs, cannot eaſily break through, or if it does, the Cold at the Roots, ſtarve the Spires, and they moſtly wither away, if not helped by Proper Means and Artful Labour.</p>
               <p>As for Clotting the Earth, it is very proper in many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; for when you have Sowed and Harrowed the Ground, if notwithſtanding ſome hard Clumpers remain, which will be in hard tough Earth ſubject to barrenneſs, which the Rain cannot diſſolve, ſo that the Grain in vain may labour to get through them, to crumble theſe then, take a Clotting-Beetle, made of ſound Wood, very hard, after the form of a Carpenter's Mallet, but with a much longer Handle, and heavier Head, and with it go over the Ground in a dry Seaſon, and daſh them to pieces, or to ſpread them the more, you may take a flat Board, much about two Inches in thickneſs, and a Foot broad, faſtned
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:174183:18"/>
to a ſtrong Handle, that on neceſſity you may uſe with the force of both your Hands, in the manner of a flat Shovel.</p>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>WEeds are very offenſive and deſtructive to Corn, in hindering its Growth; and therefore having brought you to beſtow your Corn in barren Ground, it is but reaſonable I ſhould tell how to preſerve it, that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper to anſwer your Expectation:</p>
               <p>When the Corn is ſprung up about a foot above the Ground, theſe ſorts of Soil; whoſe nature it is to produce Weeds, will require your Induſtry, and they muſt be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out, if Thiſtles, or ſuch as are great and offenſive, with Hooks, or Nippers, by cutting them off cloſe by the Roots, or rather pulling them up by the Roots, if that, by breaking the Ground, will not drag up the Roots of the Corn with them. The Nipper may be made with two long Pieces of hard Wood; riveted, to be opened like a Pair of Pincers, with Saw-teeth, cloſing into one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they may take the ſurer and firmer hold without ſlipping; and theſe may be much hindred in their Growth, by Soweing about two Buſhels of Bay-Salt, to an Acre of Land, as you do your Wheat after the Grain is Sowed; which is alſo of ſo excellent a Nature in barren Lands, that it heats them to a degree, and makes what is Sowed, proſper and multiply manifold. As alſo will, Steeping your Grain in Sea-Water; or being at too great a diſtance, Brine, eſpecial<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y ſo that you Sowe it preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after.</p>
               <p>As for the Sand, you ſand Ground withal, it muſt be Sea-Sand, if poſſible to be gotten; but if the Ground lie ſo Inland, that it cannot be done without vaſt Trouble and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:174183:19"/>
Coſt of Carriage, more than the Advantage may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to recompenſe, dig up the ſalteſt, looſeſt Sand, or Earth you can light on, and make that ſupply its place; the Saltneſs may be known, by trying it in Water: for a Quantity being ſteeped there, if it make the Water brac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiſh, you may be aſſured it is proper for your uſe; alſo Wood-Aſhes, Sea-coal-Aſhes, and Sutt, are extraordinary Manurers of Land, being ſcattered over them, or plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in, ſo that being wetted, they diffuſe their Quality of Heat, to temporize with the Coldneſs of the E rth, and cheriſh what is Sowed. But as for Rye, it muſt not be wetted, for among all Grain it grows beſt with the leaſt wet, and will, as the Country ſay, drown in the Hopper in a Rainy Day, yet where Salt, Aſhes, S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>As for Wheat, the wetter it's ſowed, the more firmly it ſticks in the Earth, takes Root and proſpers.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>To Dreſs and Manure barren Ground, over-run with Goſs, Broom, Furs, Weeds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> relating to Ground dry and wet.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving given ſome Inſight into the Improvement of barren Ground, a thing exceeding neceſſary to be known in a great many parts of this Kingdom, I ſhall proceed in it to the other Particulars, and eſpecially to the Filling and Dreſſing rough and barren Clays, encumbred or over-run with Goſs, Broom, and ſuch-like things, of Nature's Product, which hinders Land, by keeping it lean and out of Heart, from being eaſily brought to produce any thing elſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:174183:19"/>Now I muſt ſuppoſe theſe kinds of Clayey Ground, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſimple or mixed, to lie a little lower than thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore diſcourſed on, not ſo ſubject to heat, to burn up what grows on them in the ſcorching Summer, nor to nipping Froſts, to wither and blaſt in the Extremities of Winter; yet theſe Grounds, as they are, will neither properly bear Corn nor Graſs. There is another ſort of Ground, not differing in barrenneſs to this, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as are infected with noyſome Weeds, which cauſe Diſeaſes in the Cattel feeding there, as likewiſe thick and overgrown with Broom; for altho' theſe for Fuel, Thatching, or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering of Out-Houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be ſome advantage to the Huſbandman, it makes nothing near a Recompence for the loſs of ſo much Ground, as may be turned by a little Coſt and Labour to good Improvement.</p>
               <p>To deſtroy theſe Incumbrances, cut them as near as poſſible may be, to the Ground, then make them up in Bundles as big as Bavins, dry them firſt in the Sun, and then carry them home, and Stack them in a place where the Wet cannot fall upon them: for if it do, it will ſoon rot them; then ſtub up all the Roots you can find in the Ground, and lay them in little heaps to dry, after which they will become good Fuel; or burnt upon the Land, and the Aſhes ſcattered, will much ſtrengthen it, when ſoaked in by the Rain, or ploughed in the proper time; for this is about the latter end of <hi>April,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>May.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus having thoroughly cleared the Ground, take the Refuſe, with ſome Roots well dried, and pile them hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, pare up Roots of Graſs and Earth, and pile on them, leaving only a Vent, and then give Fire with Straw or Stubble, and the Earth keeping in the Smoak, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it, will, as it were, burn with the Roots, and receive the Fatneſs, and be very mellow. This, in ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, is called burning of Bail; and when it is well burnt and cooled, with Shovels and Beetles break and diſperſe it over the Land, and it will be a very good Dung, or Manure; then with a very long Plough, breaking up the Ground, and by broad deep Furrows, lay it into Lands as large as you think the Nature of it will bear, higher or
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:174183:20"/>
flatter, according to the like conveniency, as it lies more or leſs ſubject to the Water, or overflowing of Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Brooks, Rivers, or great Ditches, or Waters oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned from Showers deſcending from Hills, or higher Grounds: for theſe Inundations greatly hinder Fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by chilling, or rotting the Corn, or other Grain, in the Ground, when ſowed; ſo that if it ſpring up, it comes to no advantage.</p>
               <p>But firſt of thoſe Grounds that lie not within the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Overflowings, by reaſon of their height, and ſo of the reſt in their Order. But to the purpoſe: The Bail burnt, caſt abroad, and the Land broke up, then, if you can come by it, Salt it with Sea-Sand, after Lime it, as has been directed; or for want of Sea-Sand, ſcatter as you do Grain, Bay-Salt, mixed with other Sand; or fine fat Earth, well ſifted from Stones and Rubbiſh. Then Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure it with ſuch Dung as you have that may be proper to it, to give it a fertilizing Heat, as that of the Horſe, Ox, or Kine, rotten Straw, Mud out of Ditches or Ponds, that is fat and ſlimy, the Sweeping of the Houſe, Flowers, Mills, Barns, Yards, where Cattle trample much; and if you be near the Sea, there is an excellent Weed, called <hi>Hemp-weed,</hi> bearing broad Leaves, black, with great Heads, and twiſted like Peas-ſtraw, growing in great abundance among the Sea-Sedge, on many Coaſts; with this, when gotten, you may ſtrew over your Ground already plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and plough it in with the reſt of the Manure, and by rotting there, it will add heat and ſtrength to the Land. Let this Ploughing be deeper than the firſt, with larger Furrows, that the new quick Earth ſo raiſed up, may mingle with the Manures Hack, and Harrow it again: then take Pidgeons, and Land-Poultries Dung, (for that of Water-Fowl is naught) and ſprinkle over it, allowing, if you have it, two or three Buſhels to an Acree, ſcattering it in as equal a proportion as you can, then ſowe your Wheat, or other Corn; and for this ſort of Ground, at firſt Wheat is the moſt thriving, though it will bear other ſorts of Grain, and with care, of a very barren and uſeleſs Ground, become uſeful and very advantagious to the Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; it muſt likewiſe be clotted and ſlated; and if you
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:174183:20"/>
want Salt-Sand, or Salt, ſteep your Wheat in Brine of any Salt, and it will produce a good Crop.</p>
               <p>You muſt take care to Weed it, and gather the Stones before, that will obſtruct the Corn from riſing, and carry them into the Roads, or dry Ditches, or ſome Pit proper for them; for theſe Grounds are generally great Producers of Stones.</p>
               <p>If Weeds, which commonly breed in wet barren Grounds, grow up to the hindrance of Seeding it, or that you would be at the Labour and Coſt to bring it to fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Arable Ground, pluck them all up with your Hands, or Nippers of Wood, with Saw-teeth ſhooting one into another, to hold them the faſter; lay them on heaps, dry them, and burn them, then ſcatter the Aſhes on the Land, as before directed. Plough the Ground, but not ſo deep as the firſt, yet turn up the Furrows as deep as poſſible you can; and if it lie ſubject to Overflowings, make croſs Furrows and Drains into Ditches or Rivers, or low places, that the Water may deſcend, and be carried off as much as may be; if there be no Current, make a Pond at the lower end of it, which may receive the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but this will do but little, if it be much ſubject to Water-flowings, or Mariſh Springs, and therefore if you would uſe it for Corn-Land, you muſt find a way to carry off the Water, or it will not avail your Labour and Coſt in Manuring; Directions for which I ſhall have occaſion to Treat of hereafter at large. As for the Manuring, it muſt be as the former, and ſo all the Particulars in Management, only you muſt at the Second Ploughing do it very deep, to hollow the Ground, that the Water may the better ſoak away, and lay the Lands in Ridges as high as you can, and the Furrows as deep.</p>

                  <p> To Improve Barren Clay, Simple, or Compound, over-run with Whinnes, with the particular Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of it.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THere is another barren Clay, no matter which, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Simple or Compound, that is peſtered and over-run with Whinnes, a ſhort buſhy, knotty, prickly thing, not growing above a handful from the Ground, yet entangling in one another, and ſpreading ſo faſt, that they choak the Graſs, and obſtruct the Cattel from feeding, and the Graſs kept thus down, will moſtly die, and a moſſy Scurf cover the Surface of the Earth: yet for this dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Incumberance there is a Remedy, and this Ground I ſhall inſtruct the honeſt Farmer, how to bring to bear a good Crop:</p>
               <p>To begin this Work, worthy your Coſt and Labour, take a fine thin Paring-ſhovel, made of good tough Iron, and well ſteeled and hardned round about the Edge, and with it pare up the upper Swarth of the Ground, about an Inch and a half, or two Inches deep, turn up every Paring about three Foot in length, and as broad as the Shovel will conveniently do it, turn the Whinne, or Graſſy ſide downward, and let it lie in the Sun two or three days to dry. <hi>May,</hi> for this Undertaking, is the proper Month, and being well dried on the Earthy ſide, turn it, and let that well dry, then gather it into heaps, and twiſt it as it were into Bands, or Cords, and lay it up round and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that fire being put under the hollowneſs, may eaſily come at it to conſume it, thruſting in to the great Cavity, which muſt be like an Oven, but much leſs combuſtible dry Matter for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>When theſe heaps are burnt, break them as Bail with Shovels and Beetles, ſo that the Earth may mix with the Aſhes, then ſpread them on the Ground to an equal thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:174183:21"/>
whilſt they are hot and glowing, which will heat the Earth, and deſtroy the Fibres of the Roots that remain either of the Whinnes, or Weeds.</p>
               <p>This being done, plough up the Ground in good long Furrows, hack it ſmall with Hacking-Hoes, Manure it, and further order in all Particulars, as in the foregoing Directions for Goſs, Furs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let the laſt Ploughing be very deep, eſpecially your Furrows, and let your Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows have Weights on them, to preſs the harder on the Ground, and turn up the remaining Roots of the Whin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, which being dragged off dry, and burnt as the former, ſcattering the Aſhes on the Land; and if the Harrow will not carry them to the Lands end, have ſome Boys or Girls to follow the Motion of it, and pick them up as they ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, laying them on heaps in the Furrows, and when dry, bring them on the Ridges of the Land, and burn them; then ſowe your Corn mixed with Salt and Wood-aſhes; and this Ground thus prepared will bear good Wheat in abundance, in the ſpace of two or three Years, then ſowe Barley and Peaſe, and Beans a Year after the Oats; and laſtly, it will be very good Meadow-Ground, or Paſture, for the ſpace of three or four Years after, and then you muſt manure it again with a ſufficient quantity of Soyl, and it will continue good Ground.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>TO bring this ſort of Ground to bear tolerable Corn, or Graſs, far exceeding the Charge, and what it would other ways do without it, you muſt with Scitches, or ſharp Hooks, but old Scythes are the beſt; cut down all the Heath, or Ling, as cloſe as you can, about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>May,</hi> and let it lie on the Ground to dry, then
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:174183:22"/>
ſpread it over the Ground, and ſcatter dry Straw on it, and by ſetting it on Fire at the ſeveral Corners of the Field, in a moderate breathing Air, the Fires will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach to one another, and meet in the Center, ſo ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ground, it will kill the Weeds and Roots in a great meaſure, and the Aſhes manure the Ground, then with a ſtrong Plough, having broad Wings, Share, and an even Coulter, laying the Lands large, and the Furrows deep, not as yet troubling your ſelves to pick out the quick Roots, but let them lie in the Furrows, yet hack the Ground over, as has been often directed; and in this caſe, with your Hacks and Paring-ſhovels, when the Ground is dried, pare the Furrows, and where you ſee many Fibres of Roots, and lay the Parings to dry, then place them in little heaps near each other, in Rows, that ſo being hollowed up, and dried Heath put under them, they may burn Earth and all, which being full of Strings and Roots, will do ſo even to Aſhes; and this being ſpread, is exceeding profitable for the Ground, and being plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in at the Second Ploughing, it kills the remaining Roots both of the Heath or Ling, and Weeds, if the Ground pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any, having Dunged, Limed, and Sanded it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>When the Ground is thus Made and Manured, and the Wheat-Seed-time draws on, at the latter end of <hi>September,</hi> or beginning of <hi>October,</hi> plough very deep at the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Ploughing, even more than ever, ſo that there may be nothing of the firſt Furrows remaining, but the Aſhes that are turned up, which being covered with Sand, Lime, or Manure, the Earth will lie very plain and level, ſo that there is a neceſſity of raiſing up new Furrows, and of new Hacking and Harrowing, which rendring the Earth light, and a well mixing of all together, ſo that it may be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of bearing very good Wheat, eſpecially if Sheep have been Folded on it before, and Dunged well, which together with the Dung of Poultry, is an excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure.</p>
               <p>As for the Weeding and Cleanſing the Ground when the Corn is ſprung up, you muſt take great diligence; for though in this kind of Soyl, Cockle, Darnel, and ſoft
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:174183:22"/>
Thiſtle grow not, yet hard and rough Weeds will ſpring up, of the worſt kind; as, Twitchberries growing at both ends, Ling, Wild-Time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> pull theſe up by the Roots with your Nippers, as ſoon as they are pretty well peeped out of the Ground, ſo as to be diſcerned and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed faſt hold on; for if they grow up to any height and bigneſs, in pulling them up much of the Roots of the Grain that grows about them will alſo come with them. As for other tender Weeds, if there be any, you may cut them off with your Hook; and if fine ſoft Graſs grow up, you need not meddle with it, for it will keep the Corn warm, and nouriſh the Roots of it.</p>
               <p>Now for the Profit of the Ground thus ordered: It is proper to bear Wheat plentifully for the three firſt Years, and the fourth good Barley, with the help of Sheep be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing folded on it, or a Manure of Poultrey or Pigeon's Dung; and for three Years after very good Oats, and ſmall Peaſe the eight Year. As for Beans, this Soil will hardly bear them at all; and to the eleventh Year it will prove good Meadow Land, though the Graſs will be ſomewhat coarſe, yet good wholſom feeding Graſs as can be reaſonably expected; nay, it will likewiſe fatten Cattel; tho' in this latter, a longer time is required than when they are put into finer Graſs, where the Ground is mellow, and of a good natural Soil.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>HAving diſcourſed, as I hope, to the Reader's Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, concerning barren Clay-Grounds; the next thing, as I conceive, to be treated of in a regular Method, is the Improvement of barren ſandy Ground, a great deal of that kind, as well as the others, lying at this day waſt in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:174183:23"/>This kind of Ground is uſually ſimple, without mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xture; and though the Colours of the Sands may change, they are moſtly the ſame, and very little to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed in their Quality. There is a naughty barren cold Sand, lying on high, rocky, or ſtony places; or upon bleak Plains, expoſed to the North and North-Eaſt Winds; or bordering on the Sea, bringing forth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but an unprofitable ſhort moſſie Graſs, made bitter by the Sun; and when the cold Dews fall, it is of an unſavoury taſte.</p>
               <p>Now to improve this Ground to much Advantage; in the Advance of the Spring, with a ſtrong Plough an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the Soil, yet ſomewhat leſs in the Iron-work and Timber than is neceſſary for Clay Ground; Plough it up of an indifferent Depth, yet not ſo deep as the Clay; lay your Furrows flat and cloſe to one another, ploughing it very clean, and leaving no Baulks; but not ſo cloſe, but you may lay the green Swarth to the quick or new ploughed Earth; or rather, turn one Swarth againſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, ſo that the Furrows may lie, and only but touch the Edges one of another: When this is done, hack it into ſeveral pieces, and let it lie for many Days in the Furrows, that the green Swarths heating one another may rot, which you may perceive they are about to do when they grow black. Though theſe ſandy Grounds being eaſily crumbled, require not the Labour of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; and therefore the main of the Hacking in this caſe, is to cut the Swarth that it may rot; and it is only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in barren Sands, which have ſome toughneſs in them, and not in thoſe that are very looſe and fruitful.</p>
               <p>When you have thus ordered your Ground, there is a way to be uſed contrary to the former, which is to Marle it. And now becauſe this is a very hard Term to ſome, and not every-where in uſe, becauſe not to be had, I ſhall declare what <hi>Marle</hi> is, before I proceed further:</p>
               <p>This Marl is a certain rich ſtiff Clay, an Enemy to all Weeds that ſpring up of themſelves; and gives genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Virtue to all Seeds that are ſown in the Ground. It is of a glewy Subſtance, and not fat or oily, as ſome ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it: It is in Quality cold and dry, and was Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:174183:23"/>
it came to be Marle; and being made Marle, it is no more but a Clay Ground: As for this, when it is a little hardned, it is only diſſolved by Froſts; and this is the Reaſon it always worketh better Effects the ſecond Year than the firſt.</p>
               <p>As for the Colours of the Marle, they are different; as, a White, a Ruſſet, a Grey, a Yellow, and a Black, and ſome other Colours, yet all theſe may be reconciled; for the Colours may alter according to the ſtrength of the Sun, and the Climate they are produced under.</p>
               <p>This is ſo good a Manure, that well layed on it will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich the barreneſt of the Grounds for Ten Years, and ſome for Thirty. To find it, take an Auger-Wimble, made to hold many Bitts, one longer than another, ſo wring them into the Ground, till you have tryed, by drawing the Earth in one place, then proceed in the moſt likely places, till you come to the Marle: And the moſt proper places to make this Eſſay is, in the loweſt part of high Countries, near Brooks and Lakes; and in the high parts of Low Countries, upon the Knowls of little Hills, and in the Clefts of ſteep Banks, or Breaches in Hills, opening of themſelves; in ſome places it lies deep, in ſome again ſhallow; and commonly theſe barren ſandy Grounds are verged with it lying very deep.</p>
               <p>Having found it, dig it up in great Lumps, and bring it to your Land with what ſpeed you can; lay it on Heaps a yard Diſtance one from another, and when i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

And having thus done, when Seed-time comes, plough it again deep, that the new-broke-up Earth may mix with the old, and lime it a little; for the Nature
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:174183:24"/>
of the Ground requires not ſo much of that as the Clay Ground.</p>
               <p>This Ground will bear Wheat well, but is moſt attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to Rye, which will grow on it in abundance. If you ſow Wheat, ſteep it in Salt-Water; and for the other, mix a little Bay-Salt with it when you ſow it. The Weeds this kind of Ground is moſt ſubject to, are Wild Harbottles, Cheſsbeles, Gipſie-Flowers, and the like, which may be taken out by drawing up the Roots, or cutting off the Stalks cloſe by the Ground.</p>
               <p>The Ground thus ordered will bear Wheat or Rye three Years, and after that Barley with once ploughing, the fifth Year Oats, the ſixth and ſeventh excellent Lupines, and then it will be good Paſture three or four years, after which you muſt dreſs it as before, to recover its Heart and Strength.</p>

               <p>THis ſort of Ground is more dry, looſe, and harſh than the former; and to bring it to Fertility, mow down the incumbring Weeds as cloſe as may be; and note, if they be high, it ſhews the Ground of ſome ſtrength; but if low, weak and out of heart: Lay them thin, and turn the Weeds you mow down, that they may dry; and when they ruſtle, that you may crumble them, bring your Plough, and turn up your Furrow, that it may lie flat to the Ground one green Swarth againſt another; then obſerve how broad your Furrow ſo turned up is, or the Ground ſo covered, and leave ſo much Space unploughed between Furrow and Furrow, ſo that there may be a green Baulk and a Furrow: And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gone over the Land in this manner, take a Paring-Shovel,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:174183:24"/>
and pare up the Furrows about two Inches thick, in pieces of three Foot in length; make them in little hollow Hills, about a Yard and a half diſtance one from another, ti l they are dried well in the Sun or Wind, and placing the Earthy part upwards, put dried Fern under them, and ſet them on fire; when that is done, and the Earthy part ſufficiently parched, hack over the Furrows that are turned up, then beat and ſpread the Aſhes and burnt Clumpers over the Ground, mixing it well with the Mould, then Marle it plentifully; which done, plough it over again very well, leaving no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unturned up; and then the freſh Ground mixing with the reſt, will augment to the ſtrength of the Soil; and this Ploughing ſhould properly be about the latter end of <hi>June.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Ground thus dreſſed, Lime it a little; and this liming will much abate the growth of Weeds, or any other Incumbrance, its acute quality deading the Roots; and above all, is a great Enemy to Thiſtles, which Fern Ground naturally alters into: After this, it requires a third ploughing very deep, and harrow it well; but my Advice is not for ſowing Wheat on this ſort of Ground, it not-being proper for it, unleſs a little on the beſt part of it for the Supply of your Family, becauſe it has not much more Strength than the Manure allows it; but it will bear excellent Rye the firſt three Years, and the fourth Barley; and three Years after tolerable good Oats; the eighth Year you may ſow Fetches or Lupins; and for three Years after it will be tolerable good Graſs, with a little Manure of Dung or ſlimy fat Caſting of Ditches or Ponds. You muſt after ſowing harrow it well, and cloſe it; for though it is Sand, the Marle and Lime will make it cling hard together.</p>
               <p>The Weeds that after this are moſt likely to ſpring up with the Corn, are, Fern and Thiſtle, where the Lime had not ſtrength to ſettle and deſtroy them. As ſoon as they appear, pull them up, and lay them on Heaps to rot and make Dung.</p>

               <p>THere are divers things that ſome, through Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, regard not, that are very profitable for the manuring and enriching of Land, as Woollen Rags; and of theſe a Sack-full and a half is ſufficient for dreſſing an Acre of Arable-Ground, being ground or chopped very

ſmall, and ſpread an equal thickneſs over the Land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Fallowing-time; and then coming to fallow, let the Plough take them carefully into the Ground, and cover them; after this uſe Stirring, Soiling, Ridging, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Rule of good Huſbandry in their proper Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>When you come to Sow the Land thus ordered, to make the Seed proſper the better, ſteep it in thick ſlimy Water that drains from Dunghils; and if no ſuch be to be had near-hand, ſteep Cow-dung in Water, and ſoak the Seed in it. Wheat will be well ſoaked in 18 Hours, Barley in 36, Peaſe in 12; Rye and Oats may be ſowed dry, for they receive more Hurt than Advantage by wet; cover and order it as has been directed in other Caſes, and fear not an extraordinary Encreaſe.</p>
               <p>The Shavings or Waſts of Horn, or the Hoofs of Beaſts, are extraordinary good to dreſs Land withal; ſcatter the Shaving to the like quantity as the Rags, and plough them in after the ſame manner; and theſe Manures will give a good Heart to the Ground for the ſpace of five Years without any renewing.</p>
               <p>The Hoofs of Cattle are approved for this, and may be got of Trotter-men and Tripe-men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and theſe muſt be ſliced, or cut ſmall, and ſtrewed on the Land as the Rags. Soap-aſhes, when the Lye has been drained from them, is of excellent uſe to ſtrengthen Land; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the Advantage it has of killing Weeds and Inſects that breed in the Ground, and eat up the Corn, being dried, beaten, and lightly ſcattered over.</p>
               <p>The Hair of Beaſts enriches Land, being ſtrewed and ploughed in, and there let lie to rot. Alſo Mault-duſt is much available, or the Excrements of Mault, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three Quarters of it to an Acre; and to enrich your Dung on the Lay-ſtall, is to throw often Beef-broth and other waſt Broths upon it, as alſo Soap-ſuds; and in ſo doing one Load will be worth three of the ſame kind that is not ſo uſed: If you continue it long, the Blood and Garbage of Creatures much fattens Dung, and makes it of excellent uſe; and ſo does the Dregs of Oil, or the Preſſings or Graves of the Whale, or any other Sea-fiſh:

So that by what I have directed much greater Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might be made than is at preſent.</p>
               <p>If you would enrich Barren Woody Land newly ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed for Encreaſe of Corn, take the Underwoods or Sprays, place them in a great hollow Heap, and cover them with the Turfs or Swarths you pare up, Ear h and all; then put Fire to the Wood till all be well burnt, break the Earth, and ſpread it over the Ground, mingled with the Aſhes of the Wood; ſpread it a ſecond time with the Aſhes of Fern, Stubble, Straw, or the like, and letting it reſt a while, plough it, and ſoil it at the beginning of <hi>October;</hi> and plouging it a ſecond time, ſow it with Rye the firſt Crop, and it will bear it very plentifully; the next may be Wheat, the third Barley, the fourth Lupins, or any other Pulſe, and then proceed to ſow it with Wheat again, and this Land will laſt in good Heart for eight or nine Years, and longer, where there is any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Fertility in the Soil, as has to good advantage been experienced in many woody parts of <hi>England</hi>

               </argument>
               <p>THis is a very difficult Point; for though Salt-water or Salt-ſand moderately uſed on Ground, gives it Heat and Vigour, yet Exceſs imbitters and utterly waſts the Strength of it, eating and ſpoiling the Roots of Graſs, Trees, or any thing of natural Growth; and therefore the Salt-water being drawn off, and ſtayed from any more flowing in, the Ground by lying low is capable of having freſh Water brought upon it from higher places, which lying ſometime, will take out the Saltneſs of the Earth the other left behind it to a great degree; it need not exceed above four or ſix Inches on the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:174183:27"/>
if the Land be level; let it lie two or three days, and then by the help of Ditches or Sluces drain it away, or by the help of Engins, which I ſhall have particular occaſion to ſpeak of, it may be thrown off into conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent places; as, over the Banks into the Sea, if it be near; or on other waſte Ground, where it may dry up; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween whiles flow it often, till the freſh Water has in a great meaſure taken the Saltneſs out of the Earth.</p>
               <p>The Ground being drained and pretty dry, about the latter end of <hi>March</hi> plough it up as deep as well you can, turn up a large Furrow, and laying it into Lands, raiſe them up as much as you can, lay them round, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve if they be ſimple or mixed; if it be Sand, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther red or brown; then take ſuch clear Earth as is free from the Waſhings of the Salt Water, being of a ſmall and mean Stiffneſs and Richneſs, digged out of ſome Pits or Banks where the leaſt Miſs or Spoil may be made; lay it in little Heaps, and ſpread it over the Land; and when dry, clot it, and break it as finely as poſſible; and this Earth will ſuck and draw the Salt into it, taking off much of the evil quality in the ſandy Ground, and alſo ſtiffning the Sand, makes it apt for Fruitfulneſs.</p>
               <p>If this Ground damaged by Salt Water be rough, hard, gravelly Earth, then ſpread in like manner the beſt and richeſt Clay that can be had, or for want of that blue Marle, which will not only ſuck up the Saltneſs, but cool and much refreſh the Ground, adding new Nouriſhment, whereby the Seed that is caſt in will be fed and nouriſhed. But if the ſpoiled Earth be a tough ſtiff Clay, though ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom found ſo near the Overflowings of Salt Water, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it over with the fineſt freſh Sand, which will ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Sand from the Clay, and take away the naughty Stiffneſs of it, that will otherwiſe oppoſe the riſing of the tender Sprouts; it will alſo give a gentle Warmth, and abate the Coldneſs of the Clay, and make it bring forth plentifully.</p>
               <p>If it be a mixed Earth, obſerve whether it be binding or looſe; if the former, Sand it as before; if the latter, ſpread it with the richeſt Clay you can get: When you have thus ordered your Land, plough it a ſecond time
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:174183:28"/>
before Midſummer, ſo that the new-layed Earth may be well mixed with the old; then take the Mud of dried bottoms of Lakes, Ponds, or Ditches, of Waters that were freſh, or Woollen Rags chopped ſmall, or with both together; cover it over lightly, then immediately plough it Land after Land, leſt by long lying the Sun at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts the ſtrength out of the Manure; then let it reſt till <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> and ſo give it the laſt ploughing, and ſow it with the hardeſt and largeſt Wheat; and for this Land, that which is called the <hi>White Pollard</hi> is the beſt; and if the Salt Water be kept out, you will have a very good Crop; the ſecond Year ſow it with very good Hemp-ſeed, and it will prove very gainful; the next Year lay it flat for Oats, and then lay it down, and it will prove good Meadow or Paſture: However, the firſt Year after laying down let Sheep graze on it, whoſe cropping it and Dung will fertilize it, and then you may uſe it as you pleaſe; either keep it for Grazing, (for it will produce extraordinary good Graſs) or for Meadow; and in a few Years you may plough it again to produce good Corn, eſpecially Wheat; for by this time the Saltneſs is very much taken out of it. And thus you may reduce all ſorts of Ground overflowed by Salt Water, where there are no Salt Water Springs to feed and float it; for if there be, and they cannot be drained, turned away, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe remedied, your Labour is loſt. Where freſh Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cannot be brought on theſe Grounds to float them, add to your former Manure Mooriſh Earth, the Soil of Streets and High-ways, the Earth dug up where Dunghils have lain a conſiderable time, Rubbiſh and Sweepings of the Houſe, Barns or Yard; and having ſpread them on the Land, take a large Hawthorn-buſh, rough and prickly, plaſh other Buſhes and faſten to it. To make it lie flat and preſſing on the Ground, tye on the upper part of it wooden Rowlers, and lay other Weights on it to faſten it to the Horſes Drawing-geer by the Stem or great Stalk, and draw it over the Ground in the nature of a Harrow, to break all the Clumpers, and lay the Earth very ſmooth after every ploughing; then ſprinkle Soap-Aſhes mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately on it, and it will loſe its Saltneſs in a little time,

very long, and in great Plenty; and once in twenty, or more, Years Dreſſing, will continue it for good Meadow or Paſture, if in dry Seaſons you have Water to relieve it, which may be gathered by bringing Springs, or the violent Fallings of Rains, into a Ditch, on the other ſide of it; or by any other Conveniency, according to the Situation of the Ground on the aſcending part, to overflow it ſo long, that it ſoak deeper than the Roots of the Graſs, to continue Moiſture for the Nouriſhment of it a conſiderable time.</p>

This Wheel is made after the manner of an Underſhot Mill, <hi>viz.</hi> with a double Ring, into which two Pins paſs, and on them the Floats are faſtned, which Floats are to be hollow, and the half moſt remote from the Wheel holds the Water raken in at the open place about the middle of the back of the Float; and as the Wheel turns, ſo the Water is raiſed by degrees, and tends towards the part of the Float that is next to the Wheel; and as it ſurmounts the Receiver, the Water empties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, one Float ſucceeding the other; ſo that at one turning round of the Wheel 30 Gallons of Water may be delivered. This Wheel ought to be about 15 Foot Diameter, and the Floats at 18 Inches diſtance, and ſo it will deliver the Water at about 10, 11, or 12 Foot above the Stream it takes it from, and may be carried four times round in a Minute; ſo that in one Hour it will diſtribute about 120 Hogſheads of Water, with 12 or 18 Inches penning or ſtopping; but an ordinary Current of Water, will very well water about 30 or 40 Acres of Land, according as it may lie diſpoſed to receive as to Level or Deſcent.</p>
               <p>When you do this, conſider the Nature of your Land: If it be a cold Clay, too much Water injures it; if light, warm, or ſandy, then a little Water greatly refreſhes it. It is alſo to be obſerved, that this Motion well ſet a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is conſtant, and will laſt ſome Years with little Charge of Repairing; and the ſlower it moves, the better it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers the Water, and a ſmall Stream will carry it. It may alſo be uſed in Draining of Lands, if a Current can be made to carry the Wheel about; and as the Land lies higher or lower, ſo leſſer or greater Wheels may be uſed; and they will exceedingly ſuperabound the Charge and Trouble, by making of Graſs grow in great Plenty, where otherwiſe little or none would appear; and by Troughs or Trenches the Water may be carried from one Ground to another a very great Diſtance, if not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by ſteep Aſcents.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:174183:30"/>There is another ſort of an Engin uſed, which is called a <hi>Wind Engin,</hi> and may be uſed on ſtill Waters, where there is no Current to carry the Wheel about, or a Dam cannot be conveniently made to force it; and this ſerves indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently for watering or drawing. Several have been the Inventions of Ingenious Men to accompliſh this; ſome have deſigned it by Horizontal Windmils, and by a Wheel, with Scoops or Buckets fixed to Chains; alſo by a Wheel carrying up the Water in Buckets fixed thereto, and by the Swiftneſs of the Motion caſting it a great way forcibly from it. But that I moſt approve on, as the beſt and leaſt chargeable, is the Vertical Sails, like the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Windmils, only they are not ſo long, though more in number, placed in an Axis of a length proportionable to the length of the Veins, the one end reſting on the moveable hollow piece of Timber that is to move round over the Pump, as you have occaſion to turn the Reins, the other reſting on a Semicircle, in which there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Notches and Stays, that it may be placed as you pleaſe: So let the Wind ſtand any way, yet by the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Semicircle you may have it at one end of the Veins or the other; and let the Pump on which the one end of the Axis reſts, be placed over the place you are to draw your Water out of, at the Noſe or Mouth, at ſuch a height as is convenient to conveigh it into a Trough; and this Pump may be made of a Diameter, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſtrength of the Windmil; and obſerve ſo to order the Bucket, that it may always dip into the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel of the Water, which prevents much Injury and Trouble to the Work. This Pump may be round or ſquare, according to the ſmallneſs or largeneſs of it. Let the Handles of the Pump extend in length to the Axis of the Windmil, which muſt, to receive and move the ſame, be made crooked, like the Axis of a Cutler's Grinding-ſtone, or <hi>Dutch</hi> Spinning-wheel turned with the Foot; or the end of the Axis of the Windmil may reſt upon a Cylinder or Box made moveable on the top of the Pump, with the crooked Neck or End, within the Cylinder; ſo that when it is turned any way, the end of the Axis is perpendicular over the Pump. And, moreover, you muſt
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:174183:30"/>
take care that the Handle or Rod of your Bucket may turn Swivel-wiſe, to anſwer the Shiftings of the Wind as the Sails are changed; and theſe kind of Mills are of excellent uſe, and to be made or manured at a ſmall rate, and are eaſily to be repaired when out of order, or taken to pieces, and removed from one place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, carrying off abundance of Water, if kept in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Motion, which a ſcanty Wind will do.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>HAving ſpoken of conveying Water to the Ground, I now come to direct how it ought to be diſperſed on it: The Water being raiſed to the height you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, cut your main Carriage, allowing it a convenient Deſcent, that it may have a good Current all along; and let the Mouth of it be of Breadth rather than Depth, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to receive the whole Stream you deſire; and when you are to uſe a part of the Water, let the main Carriage narrow by degrees, that at the end it may preſs the more forcibly into the leſſer Carriages that iſſue all along from it; and at every riſing Ground, and other proper Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, you ought to cut ſmall tapering Carriages, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the Diſtance and Quantity of the Land or Water you deſign to fructifie, which muſt be very ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and many in number; for the Water running ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and ſwiftly over the Graſs, greatly revives it. In the next place obſerve, that in drawing or watering of Lands you may make Drains to carry off all the Water, the Carriages being on; and therefore they muſt bear ſome Proportion to it, though not ſo large; and as the Water is conducted by the leſſer Carriages to every part of the Land, ſo the leſſer Drains muſt be made in the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:174183:31"/>
loweſt places to lead the Water off; and as the Carriages leſſen, ſo muſt they widen as they run to drain the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter well off, as ſoon as the Land is well ſoaked into other Grounds; for if Water be left in low places, it proves very injurious to the Graſs in the Winter, it kills it, and in the Spring and Summer much hinders its growth, breeding Ruſhes and Weeds, though when drained pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces good Paſture.</p>
               <p>Iſ you water droughty Land in the Heat of Summer, do it in the Night, or a very cloudy temperate Day, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it off again before the Sun-beams ſhine hot upon it, left that conſpiring with the Heat that comes out of the Earth, deaden or ſicken the Roots of the Graſs, ſo as it wither and flag, rather than grow to any great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
               <p>In ſome places, for the more eaſe of Watering, you may have the opportunity to command a ſmall Stream or Spring, and to bring it down by Carriages upon the Lands, and proportion them, ſmall or great, according to the quantity of Water you can give; and if it be little from drilling Springs, make Stops in the Carriages, that it may water one Land firſt, and then by the Drains convey it to that which lyeth lower; and ſo by degrees to all, as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency will admit; and the ſmall Springs in conſtantly working will bring much Improvement.</p>
               <p>As for Springs that produce a hard harſh Water, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from Alomy, Vitrioline, and Coal Mines, or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals, it is not to be brought on Lands, unleſs for the deſtroying of Ruſhes and Weeds; and afterward the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimony taken off by mollifying Waters, or well dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with fat and nouriſhing Soil, to amend the Barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and produce ſtore of Graſs.</p>

                  <p> The proper way effectually to Drain Land, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it to Fertility, either Arable or Paſture.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WHen Land is much incumbred by Water, and thereby rendred as it were uſeleſs, eſpecially where there is a Superfluity of venomous corrupting Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter lying in the Earth, much occaſioning Boggineſs, you may nevertheleſs conſider, that this Land, with ſome Labour and Coſt, may be brought to be very good; and in order to the procuring of it to be ſo, I ſhall lay down plain Rules and Directions:</p>
               <p>Take ſpecial Care in draining ſuch Grounds, eſpecially where there are feeding Springs; and obſerve in this caſe the Deſcent, that you may the better by the Drain take away all the Water from the bottom, or elſe it will be of little Value; therefore obſerve the loweſt Level of your Drain, and ſo low that you may draw off your Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and not any lower can you carry it away by this means; therefore be eſpecially careful herein; and then if you can get a lower Deſcent from this, carry your Drain upon the Level, till you find certainly you are got under the Moiſture, Miryneſs and Water, that either feeds the Bogs, or covers the Land, and go a Spade's Graft, or thereabouts, deeper, and ſo you need not tye your ſelf to a dead Leavel; but as the Moiſture lieth higher, or Ground riſes, ſo may you riſe in the working your Drain, keeping one Spades Graft under it.</p>
               <p>Obſerve, that in cold Ruſhy Lands this kind of Water that creates much Barrenneſs, is found beneath the firſt and ſecond Swarth of the Land, and beneath that you moſt frequently find a little Gravel or Stonyneſs, in which this Water is; and ſometimes below theſe, in a hungry Gravel; but it uſually lies deeper in boggy Land than in Ruſhy, and a Spades Graft you muſt go deeper
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:174183:32"/>
than the bottom of theſe. As for the Matter cauſing the Bog, it is eaſie to be diſcover'd, ſometmes lying within two Foot of the Superficial part of the Ground, and uſually within three or four; though ſome lie far deeper, as ſix and eight, or more; and having found this Spring that would willingly break out, were it not incumbred by the Load of Earth it is forced to wheeze through, and break its way by much ſpreading, dig a Foot beneath it, give it a Current in the Drain; and if it be ſwift, it will ſuck all the other Springs to it, and make the boggy Spun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineſs of the Ground to ceaſe, ſo that in a little time a Drineſs will inſue.</p>
               <p>Make your Drain from the bottom of the Bog, trench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in the ſound Ground, or elſe in ſome low Ditch, ſo low as you conceive it under the Spring, or Spewing-Water; then carry up the Trench into the boggy Streight through the middle of it, one Foot under that Spewing-Water or Spring upon the Level, unleſs it riſes higher; for many times it riſes as the Land riſes, and at other times riſeth very level, even to the Head of the Bog, into which you muſt carry your Drain, or within two or three Yards of the Head of it; then at the Head ſtrike another Trench overthwart both ways at the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Trench, as far as the Bog goeth, all along the End of it, continuing at leaſt one Foot under it; and this may work a ſtrange Alteration in the Ground, without any more Trenching.</p>
               <p>Or to work it ſomewhat more certainly, conſider after you have brought a Trench to the bottom of the Bog, then cut a ſubſtantial Trench about it, according to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſion of the Bog, whether round, ſquare, or long, or three or four Yards within the boggy Ground; for ſo far it will drain well that which you leave without the Trench, underneath the Spring-Water Round; and when you have ſo done, make one Work or two overthwart it, upwards and downwards, all under the matter of the Bog, and in a Year at furtheſt your Deſire will be anſwered.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>FEnny and Marſhy Ground is another thing to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, and great Advantages to be raiſed by well draining them, ſo that they may be converted to Paſture, Meadow, or Arable Ground; for of this Land a vaſt deal in the Kingdom lies waſte, and turns to no Advantage, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to a very few, and that inconſiderable; but to do this, it is not only taking away the Water from the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, or over part of the Turf or Swarth; for then might all Quagmires and Bogs be eaſily recovered; nor is it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off the Downfalls, as the Fen-men call them; for then that might be eaſily done, and yet no perfect Drain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for continuance; no nor the Land-falls, Land-floods, nor great Waters from off the Ground; nor doing all theſe in a way or uſual cuſtomary manner, that may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the right and proper Name of Effectual Draining.</p>
               <p>You muſt then to do it go to the bottom of the Cauſe, if you would perform the Cure, and take away that which is the Source, and feeds the Fen or Moor, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it barren and uſeleſs by corrupt and unwholſom Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and when that is done, it may be properly ſaid to be a Perfect Draining, and not before; yet the other is not to be diſcommended nor diſcouraged, where they are already done, or may be made hereafter; but the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is, in reducing it to Soundneſs or Perfectneſs of Mould, that the Wet may not follow the Plough; or it only bearing courſe Graſs in the Summer, be overflowed in the Winter; but this is well done, whether the Earth is Sand, Clay, Gravel, or mixed Earth, when it returns to a perfect Swarth, pure Turf, producing the ſmall Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, Crowflower, Clover and Honeyſuckle; then is the Quinteſſence of the Earth properly prepared; and in
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:174183:33"/>
feeding and corning they will naturally return to be the richeſt of all your Lands, as appears by many already brought to this Perfection lying near Rivers, and under the Level of the Sea; and moſt of the Ground in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> has been improved this way, to a conſiderable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riching of thoſe People by fat Paſtures and good Arable Lands.</p>
               <p>But waving ſome Objections that may be made to no purpoſe, by ſuch as are not deſirous ſuch publick Works ſhould go forward, becauſe perhaps they have a Cow, a Horſe, or a few Sheep to feed as Commoners, which can graze ſufficiently about the Edges of theſe overflowed Lands, I ſhall come to the Point, and give an Eſſay of this matter, which, well put in practice, may turn to great Advantage.</p>
               <p>Conſider then, that the greater the Overflowing is, the heavier it lies on the Land; and for the paſſing off theſe the Water-cuts and Works muſt be proportionable, and the Labourers in it the more; for this Work muſt be done ſpeedily, a little neglect ſetting it frequently a great way backwards, if the Works be conſiderable; and therefore going about this neceſſary Improvement, raiſe ſuch Banks on the outſides of the Fens, as may keep out the Land-Floods coming from higher Grounds and Ditches to carry them away on the outſide into ſome adjacent Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or Water-courſe that carries them to the Sea, or ſome convenient River; by which means you may have nothing to do with any thing but the proper Water in the Fens; then conſider how to draw your middle Trench, which is the main, to the beſt Advantage, that the Waters may paſs from others into it.</p>
               <p>Take notice of the Advantage of the Ground in all its Particulars, as to its aſcending and deſcending, its Level and Hollow; ſo that having truly caſt every thing well in your Mind, drain the Water off by Trenches or Engins that will caſt it a pretty way in great abundance from the lower parts that lie beneath the Level; alſo by the help of Men, where they are to be had, with Scoups and Buckets.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:174183:33"/>When a Drineſs appears on the Surface, and it is viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet there are ſome Springs, ſearch for them; and when you have found them, do in all reſpects as by the boggy Ground mentioned in the foregoing Chapter; and as for the ſmaller Hollows, if they dry not, it matters not greatly; if they have no Springs in them to cauſe an Overflowing in Winter, for they will ſerve to Water and Bathe your Cattle in the Heat of Summer, or produce a numerous Fry of Fiſh for ſtoring other Ponds: As like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe keep Game there, to your Advantage, by alluring the Wild-Ducks, Geeſe, and other Water-Fowl, of which conſiderable Advantage may be made; but be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry careful after this, that your outward Banks break not, to let in the Land-Floods from the Hills or high Grounds.</p>
               <p>If the Trenches are neceſſarily to be many, endangering your Cattle falling into them, you may fill the ſmaller that come from the Springs, to the greater, with Pebbles and Flint about two Foot, laying them as light as you can, and over them Flags, Ruſhes, and Turf, and upon them Earth to the Level, and the Water will find a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage among the Stones as in a Vault.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THE firſt thing neceſſary is a good Line, about 32 Yards in length, made of the beſt Water-wrought Hemp, about double the thickneſs of Whipcord, and a Hand-Reel to wind it on, that you may draw your Works by it as near unto the Streightneſs of the Line as poſſible; and by the Length you may meaſure your Work by the Rod or Pearch, to know how it goes on.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:174183:34"/>You muſt alſo have an exact Water-level near, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together 5 Foot in length; which Inſtrument many have eſſayed, and made ſome open, with a Channel for the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to run all along upon a three Inch Board, with Sights true to the Water, placed at each end, each at a juſt Proportion from the VVater to direct the Level; but it lies ſo open to the VVind, and is ſo troubleſom in remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that I approve not of it: Then make one for the more eaſie Carriage and true Performance of this VVork, to fold into another ſquare Staff, about 5 Foot, or 5 and a half, made of the beſt young ſeaſoned Oak, the Level or Barrel 4 Foot and a half, which Barrel in the midſt of it is to be planted into the top of the Staff, and ſo much of the one part of the Staff, and juſt half the length of the Barrel take away with a Rabuting-Plain or Moulding, till both join together, and with theſe Joints make one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat ſtreight Staff and formable, only about a quarter of an Inch taper upwards, from the bottom to the top, that it may not be too heavy; and the Sights are to be fixed into both ends of the Level-Barrel, that ſo they may ſtand firm and hold VVater, and yet become very little An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance either to Sight or Practice; and in carrying it, it is a ſtreight Staff, with a ſtrong Pike in the bottom of it, to ſtick into the Ground when they uſe it not; and in Exerciſe being unfolded, not much unlike a Surveyor's Croſs-Staff.</p>
               <p>The next uſeful thing in this VVork, is a Trenching-Plough and Coulter, whoſe particular Uſe is to cut the Trench on both ſides with great Expedition. To make this, take a piece of tough VVillow Timber, about the bigneſs of a Spades Stale ſomewhat ſtreight, only at the nether end it muſt look a little up, with a Neck like a Foot to run on the Ground, and juſt above the Neck muſt be placed a little Coulter, to ſhear or cut the Ground, firſt on one ſide the Trench and then on the other; and where this Coulter is wedged in, the Stale muſt be plated with Iron to hold it the firmer; and having caſt your Trench by Line, then uſe this to cut out the ſides of the Trench, which it will do almoſt as faſt as a Man can fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, cutting it out to the end by running along the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:174183:34"/>
Line; and when one ſide is done, place it to the other, and do it in the ſame manner; and this is called the plain Trenching-Plough. But if you would have this done with more exactneſs, then place in the Foot of the Staff, and in the middle of the Foot, a little Brazen Wheel, about 4 Inches high, that the Foot, bearing itſelf lightly on the Wheel, may bear itſelf with more eaſe: but this Wheel muſt be well planted in the Foot, upon Plates, and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Iron Axle-tree; and theſe you may uſe to cut Turf o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthwart, and Trenches 18 or 20 Inches broad; or ſuch a proportion as is required to carry off the Water. And this Turf and Earth taken up by a trenching-Spade, will be of good uſe to Swarth bare Ground, or fill up low Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>The turning-Spade muſt be made with a Bitt, looking up twice ſo much as is requiſite for an ordinary Spade, with a fine thin Shooing alſo, looking up the Bitt of it, very well Steeled, and more broad at the Point, or nether-end of the Bitt, than at the over-end by half an Inch; ſo that by this means, it will take up Turf all of one thickneſs, juſt ar a Natural height as a Man ſtands when he uſually Shovels: and one of the ſame Form, a little leſs, may be uſed with Advantage in cleanſing the bottom of Trenches, and are very uſeful in Banking, and Levelling high Ant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hills.</p>
               <p>The trenching Spade, is another Inſtrument very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in this great Work; which ought to be between 4 or 5 Inches broad. The Tree muſt be made more of Compaſs, and looking up by far than your ordinary Spades; ſo that it may carry a Trench level in a direct Line, move by the ſtrength of Arm, and guided by the bottom of the Belly.

               <p>This Tool cuts out its Furrow, and Coar ſo well, that within a Week, if your turn be ſerved, you may lay it down again in the ſame evenneſs, and it will be no ways prejudicial to the Graſs; and when it is a little ſetled, it will become of its former evenneſs with the other Ground.</p>
               <p>The paring-Spade is another Tool uſeful in this Work. The Bitt of this may be made all of Iron, being a ſtrong Iron Plate, having a convenient Socket to put a ſtraight Helve, or Stale into, that it may be faſtened, not eaſie to come forth again, but when you pleaſe: The Bitt muſt be made 20 Inches long, the nether-end, and two ſides, well Steeled; the nether-part of the Bitt a little bellied, or ſquared, and the ſides a little compaſſed, or hollowed; and the ſides, and end, as ſharp as they can be made; for the proper uſe of it is, now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then, to cut a Trench in Valleys and low Places, where the trenching-Plough, either Wheel'd or Plain, cannot conveniently come at it; yet principally to pare off Trenches after the firſt Year, whoſe Edges will grow ſo thick with Graſs, that the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as to its Currency in paſſing, will be obſtructed, and to dig it, will break the Trench, and cut it too thick; but with this, as with a cutting-Knife, you may take it off all along the Trench Line.</p>
               <p>The trenching-Gauge is another Inſtrument, made like a long Shovel, with a ſharp Shooe ſemicirled at the end, the Stale a little bending upward; and this is to be uſed as the trenching-Spade, in a round bottomed Trench.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p> The beſt way to Improve Drained Fen-Lands to great Advantage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>HAving already given Directions for Draining, and how to procure Materials in order to perfect ſo neceſſary a Work; it will be proper now for me to ſpeak ſomething of the Advantages accruing thereby.</p>
               <p>As for that which is moſtly dry Fen-land, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times but partly under Water, and that not always, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it according to the quality of the Soil, to be the beſt capable of raiſing preſent Profit; and if you have enough other Ground for Grazing and Meadow, you may Plough it up, and it will prove excellent Hemp, and Oad-land, produce great Crops of Cole, and Rape-ſeed, which will indeed, grow on worſe Land; ſo that by a little Marling, Liming, Aſhing and Dunging, you may Improve it to bear excellent Wheat, Barley, or Rye, ordering it as has been directed for Barren-land, upon the Account of thoſe ſorts of Grain.</p>
               <p>There is a Second ſort, ſubject only to be drowned by up-Land Floods, and great Rains, and dry when they are gone, or in a dry Seaſon; this I count worſe than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and is proper to be Ploughed up, raiſing it as high as your Drains will carry off the Water: in the Lands 3 Yards over, that will bear two Caſts of Seed, changing your Furrows in Ploughing, to ſtir up the Mould the better, that the Water may ſoak out of it into the drain-Furrows; and be careful not to make your laſt Furrow always in one place.</p>
               <p>As for the Manuring it, let it be with Lime, Chalk, Aſhes, hot Dungs, as Horſe-dung, Cow-dung, or the like; ſo in the uſual Plowing, it will bear excellent Wheat, Oats, Peaſe, and hold good ſo for three Years; but over Plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this kind of Land, takes the Heart out of it, therefore
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:174183:36"/>
I conclude it the moſt convenient, after three Years Sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to lay it down for Meadow or Paſture; or a fourth Year you may Sow it with Clover, though it will bear Corn much longer, but not a conſiderable Crop, till it has reſted two or three Years to recover its Spirits; and when you lay it down, ſcatter it lightly over with good Hay-ſeeds.</p>
               <p>The Third ſort of this kind of Land, is that which ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth very low, and deep, and has been long under Water, before recovered, that it was turned to Turf, or Bog, very little uſeful, except two or three Months in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and that in a very dry Seaſon, and this, as it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, is not good for the feed of Cattle, rendring them lean, and unſound; therefore when drained, to bring it to a better State, pare off the Haſſocks, and rough Turf, the Roots, Strings and all, and lay them a drying, conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently hollowed about the beginning of <hi>May;</hi> ſo that when it is turned and dryed well with dry Fuel, ſet it on Fire; and when it is turned and dryed well, burn it, that the Earth may crumble lightly, and ſcatter Earth and Aſhes over the Land; then Plough it up, and divide your Lands into ſuch Ridges, and Proportions as the Drain will bear; and ſo it will be fit to take the Impreſſion of any proper Seed, and eſpecially Cole-ſeed, or any Grain, if you ſay your Lands ſound and warm, and not Plough them too long; and when you lay it down, let it be either upon Oat-ſtubble, which will ſwarth it well the firſt or ſecond Year, or upon Wheat, or Rye-ſtubble, harrowing and ſmoothing the Land, and then it will be well covered the firſt Year: And, if any of theſe Lands have been recovered from the breaches of the Sea, or overflowings of Salt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, you muſt flow them moderately with freſh Water, to take out the Saltneſs; Marle them well, if Sandy, and lay on ſome heartning Soil; keep the Trenches you have made ſtrong, if they be new Works, turfing them well to the Sea-ward, that the Waves may not, by their beating, work into, and wear away the Earth: for when they are well ſetled, if they break, admit of holes, or eatings in it, is a ſign the Sea is undermining your Work to ruin it; and therefore it requires ſpeedy Reparation. Theſe Lands
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:174183:36"/>
well manured, will bear moſt ſorts of Grain, and in a little time very good Paſture or Meadow.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p> Diſcoveries of Abuſes in Ploughing, and how to Remedy them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS in all other things there are ſome Defects, ſo eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in Ploughing, which cauſe ſome to blame the Soil, when themſelves are in fault; therefore I ſhall endeavour to Rectifie ſome Abuſes herein.</p>
               <p>In the Firſt place then for true Ploughing; The Plough ſhould be rather made to be ſuited to the Irons, than the Irons to the Plough; for if the Plough-irons be not made exceeding true in all points, according to the Land de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to be ploughed, and wrought fair and ſmooth, the Plow-wright cannot work true to a falſe foundation, and if not wrought true, it will rarely go true, unleſs after much wearing, being wrought into work, it may plough, at laſt, reaſonably well, but by that time it will perhaps, be in a manner worn out, but never with that continuance and eaſe as if it were of true workmanſhip; another defect is, in not well ſteeling the Irons, and making them ſharp and well pointed.</p>
               <p>In the Second place, He that works a Plough according to the Rule he has only learned by Trade, not knowing how to hold a Plough, nor to apply himſelf to the nature of the Land, or, according to the alteration of it, may ſcarcely be able to diſcern the falſity of the Smith's work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, or un-uſed to all ſorts of Lands, and the ſeveral kinds of Tilths the Plow-man gives, his Rule cannot be certain; and therefore if he makes a true Plough, he muſt rather hit on it by gueſs, than infallibility.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There may be abuſe in him that holds the Plough, if he be not of ability to order it, to fix and alter the Irons, and the Plough alſo, if occaſion requires it,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:174183:37"/>
according to the divers natures of the Land he plougheth, and to the manner of his ploughing, and keep the Irons in a keen, and true poſture; for at ſometimes he is to throw down his Land, and at other times to raiſe it up, ſometimes to go up Hill, and at others down Hill, and then again upon level ground: and in theſe caſes, if the Plough be true, and the Plow-holder unſkilful, there is a great defect, and many good Ploughs are utterly ſpoiled in the miſ-uſage.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Conſider that all Ploughs are not to go in all Seaſons, nor upon all ſorts of Lands; therefore muſt they be choſen ſuitable to wet and dry, tough and looſe Lands, or the Cattle may he ſpoiled, the Man toiled, and the Plough ſpoiled, and yourſelf diſappointed in the well ploughing of the Ground; therefore for the diſcovery and rectifying theſe Abuſes.</p>
               <p>Firſt, As to the Smith, and his truth of workmanſhip, they principally lye in the three Materials of the Plough. 1. The Share. 2. The Coulter. 3. The Breaſt-plate, or Shield; or, as ſome call them, Shivers. All which being made true, and according to the natural caſt of the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, ſo that the Earth ſticks not upon the Plough, but the Irons wear bright, and clean, it is a proper ſign of the truth of workmanſhip on his part. Then to deſcribe theſe, If it be a Share made with a Pan to put on a wooden head, then it muſt be made deeper than the ordinaty Share, but in breadth the Pan muſt not be too large, or wide, and the Plain made broad, whelming, or deſcending to the right Hand: and in this caſe, there are theſe two Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, the deeper the Pan is, the thicker and ſtronger may the head be put on, and it will laſt the longer.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Fin, or Tuſh of the Share will whelm the more when ſet down to the Work, which is the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel or bottom of the head, or rather ſomewhat lower, which will give it a conſiderable advantage in clearing the Earth at the Throat, or firſt entrance on the Noſe of the Shield-board with more eaſe; for ſticking there, it will at once be gone all along the Plough.</p>
               <p>A Share made moſt hanging from the Noſe of the Breaſt-board, and not flat, as moſt are, <hi>viz.</hi> it ſhould be pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:174183:37"/>
or ſet on the Plough-head, a little hanging likewiſe on the Right Hand, and the Plough-head pitched hanging likewiſe: As for the breadth, I muſt leave it to Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as the nature of the Land requires it. If upon a Stony, or twitchy Wood-land, it muſt be narrower, and the more Flinty the narrower yet; but as the Land ſoftens it may be encreaſed in breadth, ſo that it may cut up ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry clean the full breadth of the Furrow you carry with you, and not take it with the breadth of the Plough, which encreaſes the weight and ſtrength, as thoſe Ploughs moſtly do, who go with narrow long-pointed Shares.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As for the Coulter, it muſt, for truth of workmanſhip, be well ſteeled, and wrought thin and ſharp on the edge, the point and the edge looking direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forward, neither carving or turning towards the Land, for that is uſually apt no draw the Plough too wide, and if it look into the Furrow, it will draw it too narrow, but let it be juſt ſtraight in a line to the pitch of the Plough. And now for the Plough-holders Direction, I ſhall give ſome general Rules.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, It is to be conſidered, whether he be able to judge and determine the truth of the Plough-wright's, and Smith's workmanſhip, and in caſe he finds therein an Error at firſt to mend it, which is then eaſier done, than when the Plough and Irons are wrought into it, or a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Error.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When he has his Plough, and all other Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutrements compleat, let him be ſure to make his firſt tryal upon workable and regular Lands, and not upon hard, rooty, or twitchy Grounds; becauſe upon ſuch, a rule cannot be obſerved, nor a true demonſtration had of the goodneſs, and truth of the Plough; becauſe ſuch Lands will more eaſily writh, and ſuddainly wrench a new Plough out of his work, before it be wrought into it; but when he has tryed, and well ſcowered it in moderate Land, he muſt bring it by degrees to others.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Having got a perfect Furrow, his Plough a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding all Earth as it takes it on a breadth, carrying a fair clean Furrow along with it, turning it cleverly from it, let him look upon it as a choice Plough, and clout it with
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:174183:38"/>
clouts or ſlips in all the wearing places ſmooth and even, ſtrengthening it with an Iron bolt at the Neck of it, from the bottom of the Head through the Beam, and there ſtrongly drawn and clottered faſt, if he have none before, that the Head may not draw the leaſt; for a Plough ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been drawn in the Breaſt, or Neck, it probably may be wholly ſpoiled. The next care muſt be, to keep the Irons ſharp, clean wrought, your Coulter edge thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> ground, the Phin ſharp, with a very ſmall point upon the Share, well ſteeled and tempered; and then if your Cattle be well matched, or ſized, it will go with abundance of eaſe and celerety, and the Ground be well ploughed, to the Plough-man's credit, and the Maſter's profit. Laſtly, He muſt be able to judge of the Land, and Seaſons of ploughing, and to ſort his ſeveral Ploughs to each alteration, or, at ſome Seaſons, he will not be able to Plough, eſpecially all his Land; therefore this buſineſs, properly timed, is a great Advantage, and much facilitates the Labour.</p>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS for Ploughs, there are ſeveral ſorts uſed in <hi>England,</hi> according to the Cuſtom of the Countries, or the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the People, and particularly four ſorts are much affected.</p>

                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Many other ſorts there are, ſome of them alter in their Heads, others in their Beams; ſome again in their Stales,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:174183:38"/>
and moſt in their Shares; of all which, it would be too tedious to diſcourſe; wherefore I ſhall properly handle the Four premiſed in this Chapter, becauſe I conceive them all very uſeful in ſome ſort of Land or other. But to my purpoſe.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Of the Single-wheel-plough.</head>
                  <p>The Single-wheeled-plough may be uſed on almoſt all ſorts of Land, and is of much lightneſs, and nimbleneſs in working. The main Plough-beam that this ſort of Plow requires, is very ſhort, <hi>viz.</hi> about five Foot, and muſt be made of ſtrong and laſting Wood, as ſmall and light as may be; to which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> another falſe Beam aded, below the Coulter-hole, under the other, and fixed to it by a Staple drove up into the true Beam, with a caping upon the falſe Beam-end, and ſome other way; which falſe Beam is that, by which the Plow is drawn, giving an opportunity (by a Standard put into the end of it, bored full of holes, and paſſing through the Maſter-beam) to let the Plough up and down to any gage of depth, or ſhallowneſs, as ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and the Beam is proper to guide it.</p>
                  <p>The Sheath is pitched very forward from the Beam into the Mould of the Share; whoſe Share, as I may term it, is made as long as the head ſhould have been, and of the ſame uſe of the Plough-head, made of two ſmall ſlips not ſo heavy as the head be: and there being no head at all, the Land-handle is put into the Share-mould with an Iron Pin, as alſo is the Plough-ſheath, and fixed there faſt with an Iron Pin, and the Share forward, made like ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Share; and before the Breaſt-plate is a hole made through the Share, and there it is riveted, or elſe with an Iron hook put into a long Iron ſlip; which is to be made an Inch, or an Inch and a half broad, coming up to the Beam, before the Noſe of the Shield-board, running through it, and is cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ttered on the top of the Beam, lying on the Shield-board, and the Shield-board is compaſſed a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the Breaſt; and ſo before the middle begins to wind and whelm toward the Furrow, and ſo more and

more winds to the very end, and this Breaſt-board is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced cloſe on the Share made with a long Point, and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row or broad Phin, as the Land requires, and ſometimes any ordinary plain Share may be uſed and placed on the Head, as other Ploughs are, either with a narrow point for Stonyneſs or Gravel, or with a broad, plain, and long-ſharp Point for mixed Sandy Earth.</p>
                  <p>The Pitch of theſe Ploughs are about two foot in depth, and 8 or 9 inches in wideneſs; and always be careful to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the uprighter you pitch your Plough, it goes the narrower, and the more hanging it is, the broader it goes: As for the depth, I cannot conceive it is much mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, becauſe it is born up from the falſe Beam, till it comes to a true working pitch; and an Iron Axletree is planted in that falſe Beam, an inch or a little more in circumference, and about a foot long, 9 or 10 inches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the end of the falſe Beam, and put in ſquare unto the Beam, that ſo it may be very faſt; and at the other end of the Axletree runs a Wheel upon it, about 18 or 20 in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and ſometimes a little higher or lower, as ſuits beſt the Dryneſs or Wetneſs of the Ground; and this guides the Plough from the falſe Beam that it cannot ſting or draw into the Ground, and ſo either with Horſes or Oxen is drawn at the end of the falſe Beam with a Cock or Clavies, as occaſion requires it.</p>
                  <p>That which is the Standard, faſtened to the lower Beam, and runs through to over-gage the Plough, ought to be near two foot high; and in the over-end two holes are to be made to put the Horſe-Reins through to come f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Theſe Ploughs are very expeditious in a light Ground, managed by one Man, and may be drawn with one Horſe to plough in Seed-Seaſon, an Acre a day. The Double-wheel-plough is extraordinary in uſe in <hi>Hertford-ſhire,</hi> and many other up-land Counties; very uſeful upon Flinty and Stoney Ground, as alſo in hard Gravel, or any
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:174183:39"/>
other hard Ground whatſoever, after it comes to exceed its natural Temper: It is uſually drawn with Horſes or Oxen in Double-geer two a-breaſt, and ſo indeed they draw the ſtrongeſt, though they injure the Ground the more by Treading, therefore it is my opinion in wet Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons they may be put to draw ſingle in length.</p>

                  <p>This Wheel-plough requires a conſiderable Strength to manage it well, becauſe of the conſiderable Lengths they are made of, which carries in working a conſiderable weight of Earth upon it, adding very much to the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of it, which in ſome degree may be remedied by contracting theſe Houghs unto a ſhorter or narrower compaſs, and taking off as much of the weight of the Wood and Iron as the ſtrength of the Work will bear upon which it is to be employed.</p>

For breadth, it muſt be pitched under the Beam upon a ſtraight line; nor is there to be any Shield or Breaſt-board on either ſide the Plough, as other Ploughs have, but a little piece of Wood ſet along the Sheath forward, about three inches broad, cloſing upon the Share, juſt as if you were to cut a Dye in the midſt from corner to corner, and place the flat-ſide to the Sheath and the edg forward, which is to be the Breaſt-board.</p>
                  <p>As for the Share, it is to be put on the Plough-head with a Phan half round upwards, and flat downwards, and ought to be ruſhed a little on both ſides, as the ordinary Ploughs are, and ſo it is to run out to a ſharp point.</p>
                  <p>Some of theſe Ploughs are made with one Wreſt, others with two, and the latter I account the beſt and ſureſt; and theſe Wreſts are to be put upon Pins, one in the Sheath, ſtanding immediately under the Breaſt-board, and the other unto a longer Pin, or round St<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:174183:41"/>
muſt be turned on the other ſide; ſo, where there is two, they muſt both be likewiſe altered, and one placed two or three inches higher than the other, and the higheſt is to be placed broader by an inch and a half, two inches, and ſometimes three inches, than the lowermoſt, that ſo it may cleverly and cleanly caſt the Furrow over.</p>
                  <p>As for the Coulter, it muſt be moveable in the Coulter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole (that being made very wide) at every Land's end; and to this purpoſe there muſt be a ſtrong Ground-Oak Plant about an inch and a half over very tough, and with that you may (having two pins placed on the top of the Beam at an equal diſtance one from the other, and both equally diſtant from the Coulter) wreſt it, or wreſt it from one ſide to another, and there hold it till you come to the Land's end, and there turn both Wreſt and Coul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>This is a very good ſort of Plough for ploughing Lands that lye on the ſides of Hills, and cannot well be plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either upwards or downwards; or if you have any flat level piece where you would not have one Furrow diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, this will perform it very well, the foremoſt Horſe or Ox going in the Furrow, and the neareſt upon the Land, and ever double; and for thoſe ſorts of Ground it is extraordinary uſeful to caſt the Furrow.</p>

                  <p>The Double-plough is in many places advantagious, taking two Furrows at once, though a very plain Plough; it is made with one long Beam, and another ſhort one, not much more than half the length of the other; the firſt muſt be made a compleat plain Plough, except the Handles, which may be very ſhort, only ſo long as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Beam with the Land-handle, and place the Shield-board on the Furrow-ſide, which may be done with a round Staff, from the Beam to the Shield-board, which Handles excepted, it is one compleat Plough in all particulars. The hinder end of the Beam muſt be left a little ſtronger, becauſe of the faſtening the other Beam firmly to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:174183:41"/>As for the hindermoſt Plough, it muſt be made in all the Members and Branches like the other, except the Beam cut off about three inches before the Coulter-hole, and the Handles at length and ſtrength like an ordinary ſtrong plain Plough; which being done, as the Handles upon the laſt Plough, you muſt ſet to the placing of it in its place.</p>
                  <p>As firſt, the Plough ſtanding in its working poſture, the handled Plough is to be affixed to the nearer ſide, or the left-hand, one Furrow breadth under the other; and juſt in the very ſame poſture, both for breadth and depth as the other, and ſo held off from the firſt Plough-Beam by a lining or filling of Wood, juſt the Subſtance as may continue it faſt and firm to a juſt Furrow, and there drawn cloſe and firm to the Maſter-beam with two ſmall bands of Iron, and a broad Slout or two of Wood, all which may be ſo keyed and cramped up, that it may be in one ſolid Beam, and conſequently move as the firſt moves, either for depth or height; and this I hold may be the beſt uſed with the Plough-foot to guide the depth of it, except you place a Wheel to the foremoſt Beam, but do it not in the falſe Beam, becauſe Experience teaches it is beſt in the end of that Beam to have as good a Mortis as the Beam will bear, which is a Mortis for the foot, and in it place a ſquare piece of good tough Aſh, or, if you can conveniently compaſs it, Iron, into which you may put your Iron Axletree with its Square, and ſo fitted into three or four ſeveral holes of it.</p>
                  <p>By the means directed, the Plough may be ſet at a Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-gage, and continue or alter it as it beſt ſuits your buſineſs; and the Plough thus accoutered, you may very well paſs it on ordinary Arable-Land, a double Proportion alſo upon Lay-turf that is clean: And this may well be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by two Men and four Horſes, that have been a little uſed to the Work; but upon rough or ſtony Land, it will not do ſo well.</p>

                  <p>There is yet another kind of Plough that will carry a Harrow after it, and do both works at once; and this is of good eſteem in <hi>Norfolk:</hi> This muſt be a common light Plough, and a light Harrow which muſt contain three little light <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

To this I anſwer, A Ridle placed on the Beam of the Plough, to ſcatter the Corn proportionably as the Harrow follows to cover it, the motion of the Plough jolting or forcing the Seed out by ſuch degrees as it proportions to being ſcattered out of the hand, and by theſe means much Labour and Time are ſpared, the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs being done at once that requires three times; but this cannot in words be ſo well deſcribed as by ſeeing and practiſing.</p>

               <p>HAving proceeded thus far, for the moſt part upon Particulars, I come now to ſay ſomething in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral about Husbandry, briefly touching ſeveral things worthy of remark; and theſe I muſt chiefly attribute to a Country, where it is tolerable, without any extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary difficulties.</p>
               <p>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s a ſufficient day's work; and in very light Ground, four at the leaſt; and what is ſowed, nay be harrowed the ſame day.</p>
               <p>An able Man, expert in mowing, may well Mow (in
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:174183:43"/>
a good deep loggy Meadow, or a rough and uneven Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow) about an Acre and a half in a day; and of ſhort thin upland Meadow, at leaſt two Acres each day.</p>
               <p>As for moving Barley, or Oats, if they be loggy, thick, and beaten down to the Earth, making fair work, and not cutting off the heads of the Ears, leaving the Srtaw ſtill growing, one Acre and a half a day: but if it be thick and upright, then two Acres, or two and a half may be reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably mowed. If the Corn be ſhort and thin, then he may Mow three, and ſomewhat more, without over-labouring. Of Beans, he may Mow as much; and of Peaſe and Beans, having a Hook to follow him, no leſs; for this is a Work the leaſt troubleſome.</p>
               <p>As for Reaping, one Man with a Binder may compaſs an Acre of Wheat, or Rye in a day, if it be choice good, and well ſtanding; but if flatted, or beaten down, then three Rood is very reaſonable, and five Rood if it be thin and upright. Of ſmall Peaſe, Fetches, and the like, he may cut up two Acres a day. As for the gathering and inning of Grain, it cannot be well proportioned, becauſe ground bears more or leſs, the inning may be at a nearer or far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſtance; and therefore I ſhall leave this to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's care, or ſuch as he ſhall appoint to ſee it haſtened, with as much convenient ſpeed as may be.</p>
               <p>In thraſhing Corn, care, as well as haſte, muſt be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; and if the Corn be full and clean, free from any abuſe, or poverty in the Grain, a Man may Thraſh, and order, four Buſhels in a day of Wheat or Rye; ſix of Oats or Barley; eight of Peaſe or Beans; eſpecially if the Peaſe be full and in plenty, otherwiſe he cannot Thraſh ſo many of them as of any other Pulſe; for though they require as many ſtrokes, and as much turning, yet they yield not, and labour is beſtowed of them when they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it not.</p>
               <p>As for the labour of Ditching, a Man may, in one day, Ditch and Quickſet, of a reaſonable Ditch, three Foot deep, and four broad, a Rod or Pole, allowing ſixteen Feet to the Pole; and ſo leſs Ground of large meaſure, leſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the ſufficiency of the Fence undertaken.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:174183:43"/>As for Hedging, If it be ſubſtantial and good, <hi>viz.</hi> five foot high, well bounded, thick ſtocked, and cloſe layed, two Pole or Rod in a day is ſufficient; but thinner and lower, then double or equivolent to a proportion.</p>
               <p>Plaſhing and making Quick-fence, is another labour, which to well order, if the growth be high and well grown, you muſt lay it thick and cloſe, ſtrongly binding in the tops, turning the quick downward and inward; and of this a Rod a day is a good day's work: but if he plaſh it down, and only lay it along, regarding more thickneſs than comelineſs or order, then he may do as much more with eaſe: and indeed the care of fencing in incloſed Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries is one principal matter, for a good Fence once made and ſetled, ſaves a Man a great deal of labour and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>As for Delving or Ditching, which ſome Grounds re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, where Woods have been grubbed up, and not well cleared of the ſpreading Fibres of the Roots; then, of very difficult Ground, if it be to level, he may dig a Rod in a day: but if he dig very deep and trench it, or manure it, as is proper, then three parts of a Rod is ſufficient: for as ordinary delving requires but one Spade's graft extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, to take up the heart of the Ground, requires much more.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>AS for the Office and Duty of a Huſbandman, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires great care and diligence, and therefore I ſhall ſpeak ſomething farther of it than yet I have done.</p>
               <p>And firſt, to lay his Lands to his own profit, and the eaſe of the labouring Cattle; let him obſerve if his Arable Land ſhall lye againſt the ſide of any ſteep Hill, as moſtly barren Lands do not, then plough ſuch Lands directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Hill, beginning below, and ſo aſcending upwards, if the aſſent be not very eaſie; for this will ſo weary your Cattle, and make them irkſome, that they never go through it, if it be any thing conſiderable, and the beating and toiling them, will ſurfeit and ſpoil them; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray, in ſuch Grounds, plough it ſideways overthwart the Hill, that your Beaſts may tread on the level Ground, and ſo ſhall the Compoſt and Manure which is laid on, not be ſoon waſhed away from the upper part, becauſe the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows not lying ſtraight downwards, the waſhings of the Rain ſtop, and cannot deſcend, and ſo the Soil is kept in.</p>
               <p>In the next place, it is a Huſbandman's care, to know what Cattle are fit for draught, and the Tillage of his Ground; whether Oxen, or Horſes, or both of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: In cold ſtony mountianous Countries, Horſes are preferred, though in moſt Counties Oxen are ſure, and of great value in this Labour, as being ſteady, very ſtrong, and ſober in their pace, ſo that the Ground may be plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deep, and carefully; and beſides, when their Labour is done, they turn to advantage by their Hides, Fleſh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in many Counties, Horſes are preferred, becauſe they
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:174183:45"/>
ſerve for other uſes, not proper to thoſe, and endure Wet and Hardſhip better; and indeed in driving, if you make that ſpeed with your Oxen as you do with your Horſes, you will not only tire, over-heat, bruiſe and ſpoil them, but render them unfit for Labour or Feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but if you have a ſufficient Stock to keep Oxen and Horſes, put the firſt to plough near home, and keep them to their moderate pace only, and they will do well enough, and let the letter draw the Cart, or be uſed at the Plough where Expedition is required, according to the Roads or Ground, as the Countries lay, or the Faſhion uſed among your Neighbours, though I cannot conſent that Cuſtom is ſo much to be followed as ſome plead for, if it be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to Reaſon and true Experience; therefore induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Husbandmen try many ways, and ſtick to that which redounds to their beſt advantage.</p>

               <p>In the Month of <hi>January,</hi> if you live in a good fertile Soil, among rich ſimple Clays, in the firſt place plough up the Peaſe-ground, that it may lye to take bait before it be ſown; but if in fruitful and well-mixed Soil, then in this Month; if the Weather be open, water ſuch Paſture and Meadow-Grounds as require it: Drain, and make dry Arable-Lands, eſpecially where you are to ſow Peaſe, Oats or Barley; the following Seed-time ſtub up the rough Ground you intend to ſow the Year following, and for

your own Health keep warm your Body; feed on good wholſom Diet, and rather with Exerciſe than Sauce, whet, and encreaſe your Appetite.</p>

Toil the ſooner; Forbear Ments that are ſlimey; take heed of cold and plegmatick Humours, and if need, or any accident require, bath and purge; and if the Weather be ſutable, you may bleed, but not too laviſhly.</p>
               <p>In <hi>March</hi> end the ſowing Seaſon of all ſorts of ſmall Pulſe, and begin Barley, Rye and Oats; the Rye muſt be that which is called <hi>March</hi> Rye. This Month, if neceſſity require it, you may often bath, but not bleed; unleſs it be upon Extremities; purge gently, and let your Diet be temperate and cooling.</p>

               <p>Piſmires are another great Devourer of Corn, and will carry or bite off Chits or Sprouts, ſo that it will never grow, but rot in the Ground a great quantity: To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this, ſearch your Corn-fields well, eſpecially under the Hedges, and the Roots of old hollow Trees, or on the Tops of Hills caſt up; and if you find them there, pour Limed-water ſtrong and hot amongſt them, preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after Sun-ſetting, and it will deſtroy them; for want of Lime make a Lye of Wood-aſhes, and it will do the ſame, though not ſo effectually.</p>
               <p>There are another ſort of Corn-Devourers, called <hi>Dores,</hi> great black Clocks or Beetles, which lye under the Clods, and in Sprouting-time do great miſchief: To deſtroy theſe, make great Smoaks in your Fields in a ſtill Night, or a little breathing Wind that may carry it over the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the Ground, with wet Rubbiſh or moldy Peaſe-ſtraw, Hay, or the like, and it will either kill them, or chaſe them from your Ground, for they are the greateſt Enemies of all others to Smoak, and can leaſt endure it; and if your Ground be Limed, or you ſow Lime among your Corn, you may ſpare this; for if they bi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Field-Rats and Mice, alſo Water-Rats, deſtroy much Grain: To prevent this, and ruin them, find out their round holes when the Field is bare, and put Hemlock-Seed into them, and eating it will kill them; the ſpink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Juice of Hellebore in them, will do the like; but above all, I approve to beat the common Graſs very ſmall, mix it with a little Coperas, Vetriol, and Coarſe Honey, make it up in Pellets, and ſcatter it in their Haunts, in the mouths of their holes, or the moſt likely places, and the Scent will greedily draw them to it from all parts, and, once eating it, they will die: This may be

alſo uſed in Granaries or Barns for other Rats and Mice, with good ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>Slugs and Snails do much harm to Corn, and Peaſe juſt ſprouting up: To kill theſe, the beſt thing is Soot or Lime ſprinkled thinly over the Ground, for touching it they will die.</p>
               <p>Graſhoppers in ſome meaſure do much Injury, by feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Leaf and Bloſſom of Corn and Pulſe, from the earlieſt to the lateſt: Theſe are hard to be deſtroyed without very great labour, and that is by ſprinkling the Corn with Water wherein Wormwood, Rue, or Centau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, has been boil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Moles are two ways deſtructive to Corn, <hi>viz.</hi> in eating the Roots, and rooting it up, not making diſtinction of any ſort, but taking all alike: There are divers ways of taking them, but not ſo eaſily when the Corn is well grown, for then they do their chiefeſt miſchief, when their Tracts, or the Caſting up of their Hills cannot be ſo eaſily diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered: However, you muſt do it as well as you can, and when you ſee them caſting up, or moving in their Tracks, ſtrike them with an Iron of many Spears; or dig Pits in their Tracts, and ſet earthen glazed Pots, which they will blindly fall into, and cannot ſcramble out; or fill a earthen Jugg with Pitch, Roſin and Brimſtone, with ſome looſe Tow or Rags, and, firing it, clap the Neck to the mouth of the hole, and the Air in the Earth, drawing the Scent to a great diſtance, will ſtifle them; or mix the Juyce of Hellebore with Rye-meal, ſcatter little bits in the Furrows, and finding it in their way, they will greedily eat it and die.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THere are other Miſchiefs that befal Corn, though not from living Creatures, which I have laboured to find ſome ſuitable Remedies for in the trying many Experiments.</p>
               <p>To prevent the Smuttineſs and Mildew, before you ſow your Grain, ſprinkle the Ground over lightly with Chalk beaten very ſmall.</p>

                  </gap>e. This will likewiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy Flies; and other Black Froſts are very injurious to all Grain, the piercing Cold chilling or killing the fertile Heat that propagates the Growth, and either withers or ſtints it if it be extream, and without Snow: To bed it, and keep off the bleak Winds, there is no better Remedy againſt this than to ſtrow Aſhes over your Land, either Wood or Sea coal; and they add much Heat to it, and keep off a great part of the Cold; ſome throw rotten Straw over it, but that proves a great Incumbrance; the other nouriſhes the Ground, and is good Manure for bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren Earth.</p>
               <p>As for Snows lying on the Ground, it injures not the Corn; but upon Thaws, the Water being of a harſh Allomy nature, much injures the Roots if it lie long upon it; and
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:174183:49"/>
the beſt way to prevent it, is to lay your Lands high, your Furrows deep, and to have ſuitable Drains to the Lowneſs of your Ground, to drain it away as faſt as may be.</p>
               <p>Miſts and Fogs are very offenſive, where they are great, or riſe from ill-ſcented Grounds, eſpecially from Fens, Salt-Marſhes, Standing-Pools, Lakes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The way of remedying this evil is to ſmoak the Land in the Evening with any ſort of Fuel that caſts a groſs thick Smoak, which will in ſome meaſure diſperſe and dry up the Vapour that would otherways, by falling on it, be poiſonous and offenſive to the Corn.</p>
               <p>Of Corn reaped wet, there comes great damage; for being ſo by Rain, and not time given it to dry abroad, or by the Unripeneſs, or too Greerneſs of it when mowed, if the Heat be great thereby contracted, it often ſets it on fire; if leſs, it moulders, rots, or moulds the Straw and Grain, that it is of little or no value: You may know when the Corn is ready to reap by the much bending of the Ear, drineſs of the Stalk, and hardneſs of the Grain; then if you ſee any Weeds growing up among it, that are but of a moderate height, reap it as ſoon as you can to take in the leſs Weeds, or the Seed of them to encumber or worſen it: If Graſs be grown high among it, and you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not avoid reaping it with the Corn, take care to ſpread it thin before you ſheave it, and dry it well in the Sun till it wither and become as Hay very dry, and then ſheave it up, and ſhock it in ſmall Shocks; then when it has ſweat a little open it, and give it the Sun and the Air, that it may yet be more dry; then lay it in greater Shocks, and let it ſweat again, and ſo open it, and when it is by this means well opened and dried, Inn it; but ſometimes Rain or great Miſts, cauſes a Weakneſs; if it be before the Reaping, let it ſtand ſomewhat longer in Expectation of a favourable Seaſon; but if your Expectation be fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and by the abundance of falling Rains the Corn is likely to be beaten down, grow again, or rot, you muſt make a Virtue of Neceſſity, reap it, carry it home, and having aired and dryed a little under ſhelter, you muſt have Kills to dry it, often turning and ſhifting the Sheaves; and when it is dry, let it cool well, and mow

it up lightly that the Air may come plentifully amongſt it, leaving for that purpoſe a hollow in the middle of the Mow and underneath, and ſo it will be kept good and ſweet.</p>

               <p>WHere there is not a Conveniency of Houſing, there is a neceſſity of Stacking Corn, and care muſt be uſed for the well-ordering of it this way, that it may be preſerved with the leaſt loſs, alſo from Wet and Moulding; for a moiſt Ground, if the Stack be unadviſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly placed on it without any other Remedies, will ſpo l at leaſt a yard of the Bottom; and therefore you muſt make and raiſe your Ground on purpoſe with Gravel, Sand and Pebles, or other Stones not ſubject to breaking, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable for a Stack, either round or a ſquare, or triangu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, diſtant from Eves-dropping, or the Driping of Trees; and ſo that the violent Winds cannot blow the Rain, or Melting-Snow off from them (though they ſtand at ſome diſtance) upon the Stick; yet ſo that it may ſtand ſafe ſheltered from high turbulent Wind, that would ariſe or uncover it; then, upon the Earth ſo rais'd above the level of Water, occaſioning Overflowings by ſudden Showers, make four pieces of Stone or Timber like Blocks, broad on the lower-end and narrower on the top, of equal height about two foot and a half, and fix the lower-end a little in the ground, that they may ſtand ſteady; then lay on their tops ſquare Boards two inches thick, and three foot ſquare every way, ſtrong and ſubſtantial, well-ſeaſoned, and free from warping; then take ſtrong Over-lays of Wood, and lay them from one Board to another

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:174183:51"/>
that which is called Waſhed Corn, ſuch as grows in the middle of the Ear when the reſt is ſmutty; and being thraſhed out with the Smuttineſs about it, is blackned, and ſo not fit for the Market till it is waſhed clean.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) To know this from other Corn, take up a handful, and if it look clear, bright, and ſhining, without Change or Difference of one entire colour, then it is good Corn, and not waſhed.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) If at the ends it looks whiter than in the middle, and the Whiteneſs be a darkiſh muddy colour, and not ſhining, there being a changeable colour in it, then it is Waſhed Corn, and not fit to be ſown.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) If you put a few Grains of it in your Mouth, and in chewing the Taſte be ſweet and pleaſant, alſo mellow and gentle between your Teeth in the chewing, then it is not waſhed; but on the contrary, if it have a bitteriſh or flaſhy raw Taſte, gritting or grinding hard between your Teeth with a Roughneſs, then it is Waſhed Corn; alſo when Corn is more than ordinary dry or moiſt, thoſe are ſigns of Naughtineſs for Seed, though not ſo bad as the former, ſhewing either imperfection in the Corn, or in the keeping of it; for good Corn ever holds an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent temper between Moiſture and Drineſs: And theſe things ought mainly to be conſidered, becauſe it is not only the loſs of the Seed, but the Expences and Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.</p>
               <p>There are other things very materially to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; as firſt, The well-keeping of Corn, which is two-fold, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Ear, and out of the Ear: As for the firſt of theſe, I have deſcribed in the manner of Shock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Drying, and Stacking; and for the ſecond, it is the moſt material, when it is thraſhed out, and well dreſſed, by ſevering it from the Chaff, Cockle, or any offenſive Seeds of Weeds growing up among it; and in this caſe your Granaries, or other places of keeping it, muſt be conſidered to be made ſundry ways, according to the Cuſtom, or rather Nature of the Country: Some are made with Clay, ſome trodden with Straw and Hair, the former chopped ſmall, and ſuch like: But theſe I like not, for they ſooneſt corrupt the Corn; for, notwithſtanding their
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:174183:51"/>
Warmth, which is a Preſerver, they however produce ſuch Duſt as produce Mites, Weavels, and other Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, Deſtroyers of Corn, ſo that they make it eaſily rot.</p>
               <p>Others of Stone and Lime are ſubject to Sweatings in wet Weather, and by the Moiſtneſs corrupt the Corn.</p>
               <p>Some again are made of Lime and Brick, and theſe indeed are very good to prevent the coming or breeding of the Weavels, and other ſmall Vermin; but the Sharpneſs of the Lime is unwholeſom for all ſorts of Grain.</p>
               <p>The beſt then that I can adviſe to, for the keeping of all manner of Grain, is that made of Plaiſter, burnt and brought into a Mortar; ſo that by the working of ſmall Stones into the midſt of it, the inſides and outſides may be ſmoothed with the Plaiſter, the Stones being hidden at leaſt two fingers thick on each ſide, and all the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom is proper to be plaiſtered, it being the beſt of all Flores for the keeping of Corn of any ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Where this Conveniency is not, or at leaſt you will uſe Hutches, Bins, or dry Fats, and the like; they muſt, if fit for uſe, be made of dry or well-ſeaſoned Oak-boards, very plainly ſmoothed, cloſely joyned, and glewed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with Leds and Covers made very cloſe, to prevent as much as may be the Coming in of the Air; but the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple uſe of theſe are to keep Malt in after it is dried, or Barley to be ground, or feeding Cattel.</p>

               <p>To preſerve Oats after they are thraſhed and dryed, put them into a cloſe Graner, or Cask, free from moiſture, and they will keep many Years; and Oat-meal is preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the ſame way, though it is proper it ſhould, if poſſible, have ſome air of the Fire; for the warmer it ſtands, the longer it will continue ſweet and good.</p>
               <p>As for the well-keeping of Meal, let it lye about a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night in the Bran before you bolt it, and then you will have near half a Peck in a Buſhel more, than if you had boulted it as ſoon as ground; put it then in dry, and well-ſeaſoned Casks, tread it in by degrees as hard as you can, head it cloſe from the Air, and when you take any out, let no more be taken out than what you preſently uſe, and ſo it will keep well a long time; but if it has come by Sea, or in rainy damp weather, then lay it abroad on Sheets, and air it, and it will keep it ſweet, and a little tainted, reſtore it.</p>
               <p>To preſerve Peaſe, or Fetches, which of all other Grain are moſt ſubject to rottenneſs, and imperfection, being of their own nature apt to breed Worms, Weavels, or Mites,

through the too much ſweetneſs of the Kernel of the Grain; to keep them then long and good conditioned, dry them either in a Kiln, or the Sun, eſpecially thoſe you uſe for Diet, or Provinder, and lay them in Graners or Floors that are dry, and they will laſt ſound and good a long time, and not be ſubject to any corruption, or breeding Inſects; lay them in thick heaps, and ſo they will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved moiſt the longer time; for if they be too much dryed in the Air, by lying thin, it takes away part of their ſweetneſs and goodneſs.</p>
               <p>Beans is another Commodity very neceſſary and uſeful in this Nation; and therefore among others, the well-keeping and preſerving them ought to be conſidered: Theſe are more groſs and fat than any I have heretofore ſpoken of, and by reaſon of the fulneſs of their ſubſtance, more ſubject to moiſture, and ſuch damp humours as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt them.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>SInce Hops, (though formerly not eſteemed, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as a pernicious Weed) have in the latter A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges gained a general eſteem, and barren Ground may be greatly improved by them, it will not be amiſs to beſtow one Chapter in this Book, in directions how they ought to be ordered and improved to the beſt advantage.</p>
               <p>Conſider then, that this Plant is very tender, and will not thrive to any advantage on too rich, or too poor a Ground; for in the firſt they grow up to rankneſs, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth only Leaves and no Bells; in the ſecond, very few Leaves or Bells, dwindling and coming to nothing.</p>
               <p>If you have no other conveniency but the firſt, you muſt allay the fatneſs of your Hills by mixing Chalk with the Mould; or ſmall Gravel, if it be hazle, or mixed Mould; and if it be ſtiff Clay, then with good ſtore of red Sand; for any of theſe, in a little time, will leſſen fertility.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>The Ground being free from Water, it may be raiſed about two Foot and a half, and the compaſs anſwerable, neither too big nor too little, but ſhaped like a Sugar-loaf; yet ſo on the top, that the hill may be flat a little, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Rain, or the thick Dews that falls upon it mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, but ſhoot off the great abundance.</p>
               <p>Make not the hills intirely of one Mould, but a third, or better of ſuch Earth as you ſhall dig up under Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hills, and a little Soap-aſhes drained from the Lye, and by mixing them together compound your Hop-hills; but if theſe are difficult to be got, ſufficient for your purpoſe, then a third part of theſe, and two parts of natural Earth may be ſufficient for your purpoſe, though the firſt is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; however it muſt then be renewed in three or four Years, or the ſtrength of it will be loſt: When your hills
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:174183:54"/>
are made, pare up the green Swarth in the Alleys, about four fingers thick, and with it cover the outſide of your hills almoſt to the top, turning the Graſs-ſide next to the Earth of the hills, that rotting there, it may add to the manuring and and keeping them very warm; let there be ſo much ſpace on the top of the hills as may contain the Plants, and the Poles that ſupport them; only then, if the conveniency of getting it admit, take dryed Fern and ſpread it in the Alleys of a pretty thickneſs, ſo that rotting in the Winter, it will much comfort the Hill, and be good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure againſt the Spring, which being then caſt about them, will very much ſtrengthen them, and make the Plants pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper.</p>
               <p>The Hills being thus manured and caſt up, open them at the top with a Setting-ſtaff; crumble good Mould in, to lye looſe at the bottom, and then put in the beſt Hop-Plants you can get, in every Hill, at the leaſt four, being well prepared; putti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Your Hop-ground being thus fitted, and planted in the Month <hi>October,</hi> which I account the beſt Seaſon, let it reſt till <hi>April;</hi> and when the Vines of your Hops come out of the Ground to a pretty length, then ſet up your Poles long and ſtraight, of any convenient wholſome Wood; and in doing it, obſerve that in putting them into the Ground, and faſtening them, you do not hurt the roots of the Hops; a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As for weeding Hop-grounds thus manured, there is little occaſion for it, by reaſon the manure will deſtroy the Weeds; but if in deſpight of this any ſprout, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy the tender ſcions, you muſt cut them, or pull them up by the roots, as in other weedings; and with this care, barren Ground will yield a vaſt advantage: Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, before I end this Subject, it will be proper to tell you how to preſerve them from Vermin as well when they are grown up alſo.</p>

               <p>IF when the Vines riſe on the Poles, any of them happen to break looſe, you muſt twiſt them again towards the Sun-riſing as much as may be, and thoſe that mount above the Poles are accounted for the beſt; and if you perceive the Flies, or any other Inſects to bite and afflict them, ſprinkle the Vines with Water wherein Wormwood has been well boiled, and it will preſerve them: In exceſſive hot weather, water the Hills about Sun-ſet, and continue it, if no Rain fall, till they Blow, which will be about St. <hi>Margaret</hi>'s day, and at <hi>Lamas-tide</hi> they Bell.</p>

end of a long Pole, and lay them down in order for thoſe that are to gather them, to pick off the Bells, which muſt be done with much celerity, not ſuffering them to ſtay long unpulled, either in Rain or Sun ſhine.</p>
               <p>During the gathering, prepare your Kiln, heated with Straw, or ſmall dry Wood, and ſpread them on it in ſuch good or ler, that they may eaſily dry, which you may know by their bitterneſs, or crumbling between your Hands; however never permit them to continue on the Kiln more then twelve hours, and keep hot your Kiln night and day, till your whole gathering is dryed, and, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them thence, let them lye on a Floor a Day or two, to give, before they are ſacked, or bagged up, or elſe they will ſhed their Seed, wherein the greateſt virtue lyes, and alſo the Leaves be apt to crumble and break off.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THere is great Improvement to be made on barren Land, by manuring it proper for the well-growing of Flax and Hemp, Commodities ſo uſeful and very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to this Nation: And for theſe you muſt, however, chooſe proper Grounds; for there are two ſorts that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally refuſe to bear theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> The rich, ſtiff, black, tough, and ſollid, faſt Mould, whoſe extraordinary fertility, gives ſuch an overplus of ſurcharge to the Seeds increaſe, that either, through rankneſs, it runneth all into Bun, and has
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:174183:55"/>
little or no Rind, or elſe the Seed being tender, the Sod and heavineſs of the Mould buries it, that it labours in vain to get out.</p>
               <p>The other oppoſite to it, is the moſt extream barren Ground, which will not bear this, nor any good Seed; and of theſe I propoſe to treat, for ſuch as will naturally bear them, I need not ſpend time upon.</p>
               <p>As for the firſt of theſe then, though it is very good for Corn, yet for Hemp and Flax, it muſt be reduced; and to begin to do it, plough it up with a ſtrong Plough, fit for ſuch Ground; and about the middle of <hi>May,</hi> if the weather be ſeaſonable, and the Ground not too hard, ſow the Seed: If it be hard, you muſt wait for ſome gentle Show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſo that the Earth being mollified, then hack it after ploughing, and break the Clods in ſmall pieces, then if you can get any ſalt Sea-ſand, ſand it plentifully over; but for want of that, ſand it with the beſt red Sand you can get; and upon every Acre ſo ſanded, ſow three Buſhels of Bay-ſalt, then plough it again, to mix well the Sand and Salt together; and this laſt ploughing is proper a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> and then let it reſt till Seed-time; and then ploughing and hacking over the Ground, ſow it either with Hemp or Flax, as you think is moſt for your advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; harrow it well into a fine Mould, and clot it with a Clotting-beetle; then, after the fall of the firſt great Show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, run it over with the backs of your Harrows, laying an indifferent weight upon them, to keep them cloſe to the Ground, that they may break the ſmall Clumpers, and ſmooth the Earth. If it be ſown with Hemp, it need not be weeded at all, becauſe this will out ſtrip and choak them; but if with Flax, or Line, being a much tenderer Seed, bringing forth many more tender leaves and branches, then obſerve how the Weeds ſpring up, and pluck them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way till the Flax is well ſprung, and then it will conquer them, and not be overgrown by them.</p>
               <p>As for the worſt ſort of Ground, you ſhall dreſs it as you do the clayey barren Ground, I have mentioned Chap. — beginning at the time of the Year there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; or indeed, if urgent occaſions detain you from it, you may plough it up about <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> and ſo let it
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:174183:56"/>
reſt till <hi>March;</hi> and that being the proper Seed-time, plough it again, and manure it as the Clay-ground; hack it, and if the Earth be rough and ſtiff, harrow it before you ſow it, that the Earth may be ſmall, and as level as poſſible, breaking the Clots, if any remain, with your Clotting-beetle; then, after the firſt ſhowers have well moiſtened it, go over it with an even, but very weighty Rowler, treading the Ground as little as may be, and the ſwifter it is drawn the better it will crumble the Ground under it.</p>
               <p>As for Weeds here, you need not much trouble your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for the Earth purpoſely thus ordered, is an enemy to them, and will not put forth any; nor ſhall you have any trouble in dreſſing it above once in eight or ten Years; nor plough it after the firſt Year, but at Seed-times. If you can get with Drags, or Engines, the broad, black-leaved Sea-weed, called <hi>Ore-weed,</hi> growing in great tuſts, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly about the Sea-ſhore, cover the Land with them, and ſo plough them in, as they may be buried to rot in the Earth, and they will be excellent Manure, giving much ſtrength and heart to the Ground.</p>

               <p>HAving thus treated on Hemp and Flax, as to the Sowing it to profit and advantage, not to omit my former method, I have thought fit to ſpeak ſomething briefly as to the ordering it when ripe, and gathered, as to the manner of rendering it uſeful.</p>
               <p>Flax, when grown up to ripeneſs, is known by the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſs and ſwelling of the Seeds on the top, at which time gather it, and bind it in little bundles, ſetting it in the Sun to dry, that the Seeds may fall out into a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient place to gather up; and keep them for uſe, <hi>viz.</hi>

Either for Sowing, feeding Birds, making of Medicines, Oyl, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if they fall not out ſpontaniouſly, you muſt rake them out with an Iron Hatchel, or by beating with a Pole, Carding, or the like.</p>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>SAffron is not the leaſt to be conſidered for the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Ground, and is of excellent uſe in Medicines for comforting the Heart, and expelling all ill Vapours that have Death for their attendants, if not timely removed; and therefore, if for no other reaſon, it ought to be plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, cheriſhed and improved: but there are others, for it brings great profit to the induſtrious Husband-man, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recompencing his labour, if care be taken about it, as thoſe in <hi>Suffolk, Eſſex,</hi> and <hi>Cambridge-ſhire,</hi> where it grows in abundance, experimentally find.</p>
               <p>It will grow upon indifferent Ground, with little manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, if it be not ſtiff Clay, too cold or wet, but rather a compound, moſtly inclining to red Sand, and ſomewhat Stony, though a fine mellow Mould produces it better; plough this well, and make the Mould ſmall with the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over of Harrows, and beating the Clumpers; lay the Lands high, as for Wheat, with convenient ridges; then with an Iron Inſtrument like a Hoe, with a twelve or fourteen Inch'd broad Bit, draw the Furrows long ways, pretty deep, place your Roots, or Sets in them, (for, from the Seeds no advantage ariſes, unleſs they are tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplanted) let them be placed about two Inches one from other, and ſet about three Inches deep; then draw another Furrow ſo near, that the Mould turned out of it may co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the former Roots, and ſo one after another, till the whole be effected to your deſire, but the laſt, into which you muſt draw what Mould comes next. The proper time of ſetting them, is the latter end of <hi>June,</hi> or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>July,</hi> leaving ranges, or ſpaces between the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, that a ſmall Hoe may paſs to take away the Weeds. All Winter they will appear green, like Sives, but in the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:174183:57"/>
Summer, ſoon after the Flower decays, it appears to dry or wither.</p>
               <p>In <hi>September,</hi> the Flowers being blew and lovely to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, come up without any green leaves, or ſpires, and in the middle of each Flower you will find two, three, or four blades of Saffron ſtanding upright, and at the ſame time the Flower ſpreads itſelf; and when you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them thus to put out, draw them forth between your Finger and Thumb, and put them into a thick, clean Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen-bag, the better to preſerve the ſcent; do this every morning, or otherways it will return into the Flower, or Earth, and you cannot, with any conveniency, come at it till the next morning; and this you may do for a Month together, the Flowers continually increaſing, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the number of your Saffron-pickers muſt be accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the quantity of your Crop, that it be gathered with expedition; no time but the morning being proper to do it in.</p>
               <p>Saffron will grow to bear two ſucceſſive Crops, but no more; for then you muſt tranſplant the younger Roots, and lay the elder aſide, as uſeleſs. Theſe Roots are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſold by the Buſhel, and two Buſhel of good ones will ſufficiently furniſh an Acre of Land ſo ordered as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.</p>
               <p>The Seaſon for taking it up, is the beginning of <hi>July,</hi> or you may do it the latter end of <hi>June,</hi> if you ſee occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. To dry Saffron, when gathered, you muſt make a Kiln of Clay, not quite half ſo large as a Bee-hive, though in form like it, with ſmall Sticks laid over; and it muſt be tended with a moderate Charcole-fire, turned, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, ſo that that it may dry well in every part: and to know when it is ſufficiently dryed, reduce three pound, as it grows wet or moiſt, to one when dryed, and it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ordered; and of a good Acre you may expect fifteen pound of well dryed and good conditioned Saffron; though two pound, at the rate it goes, will much over-ballance your charge and labour.</p>

                  <p> Claver, or Clover-graſs, how in the best manner to order the Seed, Sow and Increaſe it, for the improvement of Land.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THere are ſeveral ſorts of Claver, called vulgarly, Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-graſs, from whence great advantage ſprings in the improvement of barren Land; it being my intent to encourage the induſtruous Husbandman in every thing that is convenient for improvement of this nature.</p>
               <p>As for the Land proper for the increaſe of this, I hold that beſt, that is dry and warm; for though it be coarſe, yet with a little Manure, it will produce excellent Graſs of this kind: Land that has been ſowed ſo often with Corn, that it will well bear it no longer without new dreſſing, will, nevertheleſs, ſerve this turn, eſpecially earthy, well-mixed Land, of a middle temper, with a little improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is excellent for it: You, for this, may manure it with Dung, Marl, Lime, or Chalk b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ment, if it be well drained to prevent overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or the Water lying long upon it; and indeed, moſt ſorts of Land well ordered, produce it, though ſome more in abundance than others.</p>
               <p>And this I ſhall lay down for a general Rule, That the Land which is not too rank, or ſat, for any ſort of Corn, is not too good for this ſort of Graſs; but barren Land, without improvement by manuring, will not produce it to anſwer expectation: as for the ploughing, uſe it as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected for Fetches and Pulſe, Chap. ...</p>
               <p>As for the great Claver, which is the beſt, the Seed of it is like that of Muſtard-ſeed, but not ſo round, rather inclining ſomewhat to an oblong: The choiceſt of this is of a greeniſh yellow colour, ſome a little reddiſh, but the black is not ſo good; and therefore in the choice of your
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:174183:58"/>
Seed have a great care, for that is the main of the buſineſs to anſwer your coſt and induſtry; and of this Seed we have as good among ourſelves as any is brought from <hi>Holland,</hi> for what by their Kiln drying of it, and the Sea, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it over, it many times, taking Salt-water, deceives the expectation of the Buyer, and anſwers little of the charge; and to get it out of the Husk, which is ſomewhat difficult by thraſhing or beating, it may be milled out with Stones, not too ſharp, and hanging at a proper diſtance, that they may bruiſe the Husks but not the Seeds; yet, ſince it is to be had ready taken out, I ſhall not trouble the honeſt Country-man about this particular, for, if he has none of his own he muſt buy it, and try a little of it, whereby you may ſee how it will ſpring up, that you may not be fruſtrated in your Labour and Expence; a Gallon, or twelve Pound, is ſufficient to Sow an Acre well, if it be lightly diſtributed, and if you Sow ſome of the Chaff of the Husk with it, it will thrive the better; and, that it may fill the Hand the better, to ſpread, mix with it ſome fine Earth, or fine Aſhes, that the Wind may not ſcatter away more to one place than to another, for it being ſo very ſmall, you cannot ſee how it lies on the Land, to know whether it is equally diſtributed; then again, it will not, as Corn, be drawn even by the Harrow; when it is not ſo, it muſt be ſowed then in calm Weather, that the Wind may not have power to drive it, but that it muy fall incidiately to the Ground: You may ſow Barley, or Oats with it, and the firſt Year it will not grow up ſo far as to hinder them; but then they muſt not be ſowed ſo thick as in other ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and when they are harrowed in, and this S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed ſown, after a gentle harrowing, or the drawing over of White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn Buſhes, will ſufficiently cover it, and it will laſt on the Ground many Years: The beſt time to ſow it, is the end of <hi>March,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> if it be likely to be a dry Seaſon; late ſowing may do in a fruitful Seaſon, but early is moſt certain; and in this manner, on Ground where it takes, it will bear three Crops, two to Mow and one to Graze, the firſt by mid-<hi>May,</hi> the ſecond about the latter end of <hi>August,</hi> and then by the beginning of <hi>October</hi> it will be grown up for Grazing, which you may continue
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:174183:59"/>
till <hi>January;</hi> it is beſt cut moderately green, when the Sap is in the Stalk and Leaf, and then, being well dried, renders it the ſweeter and moſt nouriſhing, unleſs you keep it for Seed alone, and then it muſt grow up to its full growth, and be very dry, but then Stalks are good for little more than Fuel; however, the Seed, if well got out, will recompence the charge.</p>
               <p>It is a very good feeder of Cattle, increaſing Milk in Kine, and fattens Oxen above any other Graſs, as being of a fat, ſweet, and luſcious nouriſhment; and ſow a good Acre the ſecond Year's growth for Mowing, and Feeding will return you the advantage of twelve Pounds, which is ſufficient profit, ſeeing it will grow upon Grounds of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Shillings an Acre, or under, very well, and laſt good forty five Years, with a little manure; and one advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage is in it, that when it dwindles it prepares the Land for Corn, ſo that one under another it comes to great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THere is another kind of this ſort of Graſs that turns to good advantage, and that is St. <hi>Foin,</hi> originally a <hi>French</hi> Graſs, ſo far as I can gather by the firſt Improvers of it, ſowed then upon dry husky Lands, and ſome times in their Gardens; it yields to Cattle, that feed on it, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Milk, and will grow and proſper in any barren hilly Land, though it thrives better upon Land that is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately manured with Dung, Marl, or Chalk; and when it has grown ſeven Years, the Root ſo ſpreads, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ploughed in, it becomes excellent Manure to prepare the Land for Corn.</p>
               <p>The Seed of it is moſtly like a Parſnip-ſeed, only a little browner, rounder, and fuller; you muſt, by reaſon it is
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:174183:59"/>
bigger, ſow more in quantity than that of Claver, for the ſmaller the Seed is the further it ſpreads in the Ground, ſo that a Pound and a half of this, or ſomewhat more, will go no further than a Pound of the other, for the thicker and cloſer it grows, the better it ſtocks the Ground.</p>
               <p>The manner of ſowing it may be with Barley, or Oats, and being mowed with them, may be uſed as good feed, but the ſeparating I hold the beſt; it may, the firſt ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, be mowed the latter end of the Year, and ſo preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for a good Crop five or ſix Years after, and then the Spirit decaying, the common Graſs will overcome it, and by that time it has prepared the Earth fit for Corn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
               <p>There is alſo another Graſs, by the <hi>French,</hi> called the <hi>La-Lucein,</hi> which is exceeding good Fodder, and this will well grow on dry and barren Lands, but this is not very common, nor has any conſiderable improvement been made of it in this Kingdom; however, it may be proper for barren Lands of little value for any thing elſe, and an Experiment would not be amiſs to improve it; for, by Induſtry, through the bleſſing of God, all the Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we have, have been brought to paſs to the enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and plentifully feeding the Nation, whilſt Sloth would have brought Poverty and Want.</p>

                  <p> Improvement of Land, by Sowing and Well-order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Turnips.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>TUrnips are a great improvement of Land; for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the advantage they yield in ſelling, for the Kitchen, and the feeding Cattle and Swine, the Roots and Leaves may be brought to rot on the Ground, and become good Manure; beſides, they hinder not the firſt Crop, eſpecially of Peaſe, Beans, or Barley, but being ſown when they are taken off, grow and flouriſh in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:174183:60"/>
and are properly drawn defore Barley, or Oats Seed-time, though you may ſow two Crops, the early and the latter. The Seed being ſmall, may for the better, and more even ſpreading of it, be mixed with fine Mould; or to prevent the Bugs, or Worms eating it in the Ground, with Wood-aſhes; they require, if the Ground has been well broke up, but a light plowing, but to be well har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed, that the Birds deſtroy not the Seed, which if you perceive to have been done, by the barrenneſs of one place more than another when they come up, you may ſow that again, and there will be little difference in their coming to perfection. They delight in, and proſper beſt in a mellow Ground, or a mixture of Sand and Clay; a black Mould is exceeding good to produce them, for if the Ground be hard their roots will not ſpread, or come to their full natural perfection.</p>
               <p>Of theſe very uſeful Roots there are two ſorts, both of one kind, that is, the round, or bulbous, and the long Parſnip Turnip, but the firſt is the moſt numerous and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualeſt ſown in Fields.</p>
               <p>When you have ſowed and harrowed the Seed, laying the Land as even and level as may be, go over it with a Rowler of weighty Wood to preſs it in and break the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Clods, that the growing Seed may the eaſier put through it, and when they are pretty well come up and the leaves begin to ſpread, they muſt be diligently hoed over, and the underlings culled out, by cutting them off even with the Ground, or ſomewhat lower, that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Plants may receive the Sun and Air, more freer and thrive the better; and, when they are grown larger, if they appear too thick, they muſt have a ſecond hoing, and then the tops will ſpring up amain, and the roots have more Earth to ſpread in. If you find a black ſort of a Caterpiller to light on them when they come up firſt green, or grow a little height, which poyſon and eat up their leaves, by that means hindering their growth, if you cannot flow them for a time with Water to drown theſe Inſects, go over them with a great heavy wooden Rowler, taking care that the Horſe, with his Feet, ſpoil as few as may be, and the weight of this Rowler bearing the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:174183:60"/>
tops hard to the Ground, will cruſh the Inſects to death; and if this be done in a dry time, when they are in this manner moſtly infected, the tops, with the heat of the Sun and a little ſprinkling of Rain, will riſe again, and flouriſh more than ever.</p>
               <p>To preſerve the beſt Seed for the next Year's ſowing, take a conſiderable number of the faireſt and largeſt Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nips, free from Worm-eaten, Stringyneſs, rough-Rinds, or Warts, and tranſplant them to a good Soil when they are growing to Seed, co ering them pretty high with Earth, that is, about four Inches above the Root, ſetting them a Foot and a half diſtance, and water them a little, if the Weather be very dry, and ſo let them run to Seed; then cut of the Stalks when the Seeds looſens and begins to tuſsle in the Pods, and, having well dryed them in the Sun, put them into a large Hop-ſack, and by beating them with Staves that the Seed will come out, which you may Sift, or Winnow from the Husks, and lay it up in a moderate dry place for your next Year's uſe, ſowing it as before, and ordering in all particulars, where required, as dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and you will have Winter-ſtores for yourſelf, plenty for your Cattle, and the like for the Market, if you live near any good Towns; this being a very wholſom, moiſt, cooling, and nouriſhing Root, good againſt Feavers and all hot Diſeaſes, allaying the acrimony of the Blood.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>CArrots are very wholſom nouriſhing Roots, and by them Land may be well improved, but in every Soil they will not proſper, as moſtly delighting in warm Sandy-ground, mixed with a moderate fruitful light Mould, and if you ſow them in any other it muſt be well ſtirred and manured, but where you find a natural light
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:174183:61"/>
and warm Ground, if it be but indifferently fertil, they will, however, thrive therein; you may ſow them in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals between Beans or Peaſe, laid in Furrows, and ſo reap two advantages with a little more labour and coſt, the one not hindering the other, for as much as the Carrots are ready to draw, the others will be taken off the Ground, and though in doing it, ſome of the tops may be bruiſed in trampling, they will recover and ſpring up again.</p>
               <p>The Land theſe are ſowed in ſhould be rather digged than ploughed, or if the latter, it muſt be very deep, to give the Roots leave to grow to a full length and bigneſs.</p>
               <p>When you have ſowed the Seed about the middle of <hi>March,</hi> or much ſooner, if the Weather be open, you muſt, if you ſow them between any rows of other Seed, rake them in with an Iron-rake, ſo that they may be very well covered, and they muſt lye dry, for too much wet and moiſture periſhes the Seed, or Roots; for, though the Seed be hot and requires ſome moiſture, yet a great deal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys its natural heat, and kills it; you may ſow theſe thin to ſave the trouble of hoing, but if they come up very thick, contrary to your expectation, they muſt be hoed; they alſo require weeding till the tops ſurmount the Weeds, and then they will of themſelves deſtroy them.</p>

                  <p> Improvement of Land by Sowing of Parſnips, and the well-ordering them.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>PArſnips are a good improvement, where they will kindly grow, and come up to a proportionable big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; they are a Root of a luſcious, oyley taſte, wholſom, and extraordinary fattening.</p>
               <p>The Seed of this is proper to be ſown in the Spring, and is much delighted in rich mellow Ground, which muſt be digged deep, that the Root may the eaſier ſhoot downward and grow thick to full proportion; many Fields, with a little manuring, will produce of theſe a great encreaſe, and turn Land to a wonderful advantage, where there is good Sale for them, over and above the Offal that will fatten Swine, and as much as will ſuffice the Family; when they are grown to any bigneſs you may turn Cattle into the Field, whoſe brouzing on, and tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the tops, will make the Roots proſper the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>This Seed muſt be ſown deep as can be, well raked in; they require little moiſture, and therefore may be ſown upon raiſed Lands, like Beds, and being taken up with a large Spade, that is, in length, they may as ſoon as clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the Earth be ſet to Sale, or elſe you may keep them a long time in good dry Sand, cutting off their tops to prevent their growing.</p>
               <p>Another uſeful thing that may make good improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though not in ſuch a general manner, are Pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes; theſe being once in the Ground will ſpread extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and if a Root be cut in many pieces it will every part of it grow; they are very nouriſhing and wholſom to the Stomach, and a little piece of any ordinary Ground will produce a ſufficiency for the uſe of many Families a whole Winter, and many ſucceeding Winters, their encreaſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:174183:62"/>
very great; but you muſt not ſow them in Stoney Ground, for that will much hinder their growth, and make them wrinkled and ill-favoured.</p>

               <p>A Gallion of this Seed is ſufficient to ſow an Acre, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, for the better ſpreading two Gallons of Earth, or Aſhes, to every Quart; ſtir the Compoſition often, to mix it, leſt the Seed ſink to the bottom and ſo deceive you; caſt it out at arm's end in as even a compaſs as poſſible, and in the Summer you will receive a good Crop; and when it comes to ripening, be curious in obſerving it, for if you let it grow too long the Seed will fall out; if not long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:174183:62"/>
neither that nor the Stalk will be perfect; and therefore note, both the ripening of the Seed and the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Stalks; and when you perceive it properly ripen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, pull it up by the roots, bind it in little bundles, placing them in little ſhocks, that the Sun and Air may freely pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate to dry them; and in houſing, be careful not rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to uſe it, leſt the Seed fall out; and by this, well or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, there is conſiderable profit to be gained, as ten times the charge and price of the Land, if it comes to a good Market.</p>
               <p>The Seed may be thraſhed out with ſmall Poles, or Wands, on a clean boarded-Floar, ſo cloſe joynted that they cannot run into the crevices, which may be reſerved for ſowing again; it colours a bright yellow and a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Colour excellently well, and with the Stalk the Root muſt go, being of the ſame efficacy; and a great pity is it, that it is not more improved, ſince it may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy ſtore of Land that lies in a manner altogether uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>WOad is another uſeful and very profitable Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, laying the foundation and ſolidity of very many Colours, and a Woad-red Colour is free from ſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, excellent for holding its colour, and almoſt every ſad holding Colour muſt be Woad, therefore it conſequently is of great uſe and advantage in Dying. The Stalk is ſmall and tender, the Leaves of a blue green Colour, the Seeds is like to the Aſh-keys, or Seed, but not ſo long, like little blackiſh Tongues, the Root ſimple and white, it beare h a yellow Flower.</p>
               <p>This, contrary to the other, requires very rich Land, that is warm and ſound, either a little Sandy or Graveliſh
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:174183:63"/>
will do, though the purer warmer ſolid Earth is the beſt; Land exceeding rich, though it ſhould be mixed with a little Clay, is alſo proper, if warm; in great deep rich Paſtures, many hills and hill-ſides are good Woad-land, when the bottom-ground will not ſerve it; but the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Ground is the home-Cloſe, or leſſer Ground, lying near about, and bordering on Towns. The beſt natural parts of this Kingdom for Woad, are ſome parts of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter-ſhire</hi> and <hi>Warwick-ſhire, Oxford-ſhire, Northampton-ſhire, Glouceſter-ſhire, Leiceſter-ſhire,</hi> and <hi>Buckingham-ſhire,</hi> with ſome other places.</p>
               <p>The Ground for this muſt be choicely ploughed, and if very hilly, they muſt be caſt well, that they may lye e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and fair on the ſuperficial part of the Earth, and then well harrowed; about four Buſhels will ſufficiently ſow an Acre, which done, you muſt cover it with a Harrow very fine, and break all the Clots, picking the Stones and Rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh off the Ground, that it may come eaſily up; the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per time of ſowing is in the middle, or towards the end of <hi>March.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the Land is ſowed and it begins to ſpring up, as ſoon as any Weeds appear they muſt be taken out, and be from time to time kept as free from them as may be, and when the Leaf is come to full growth, which will be ſome times ſooner, and at others later, as the ſeaſonableneſs of the Year produces, dryer or moiſter, you muſt cut it up and carry it to the Mills to be ground, and when it is ſo, make it up in little Balls and dry them well for uſe: And good Woad, in a ſeaſonable Year, may very probably yield five or ſix Crops, and ordinarily four and three, and the Winter Crop is excellent for Sheep, keeping them from the Rot and many other Diſeaſes; it likewiſe, contrary to the Opinion of ſome, prepares the Ground very well for Corn, and good Eſtates have been gotten by it: The beſt Woad has been ſold from twenty to thirty Pound a Tun.</p>

                  <p> Improvement of Land by ſowing Madder, and how to order it.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MAdder is a very good improver of Land, and is much uſed in Dying, there is but one kind of it which is manured and ſet for uſe, but there are many things like it, as Gooſe-graſs, ſoft Cliver, Croſswort, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, Bedſtraw, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> which have all Leaves like Madder, and are ſuppoſed to be a wild kind of it; it has long Stalks and trailing Branches on the Ground, rough and full of joynts, and every joynt ſet with green rough Leaves, in the manner of a Star; the Flowers grow on the top of the Branch, of a faint yellow Colour, after which, comes the Seed round and green; the Root creeps far in the upper Cruſt of the Earth, one Root entangling into another, and when it is green and freſh the Root is of a reddiſh Colour, ſmall and tender; and although it bears a Seed, yet in this Country it comes not to perfection, and therefore it muſt be planted from the Sets that are to be gotten from the Madder; and the Seaſon of getting, or drawing them is <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April,</hi> as ſoon as they are ſprung out of the Ground about three Inches, every Sucker having ſome ſpines of Roots growing from it, being ſlipt from the main Root; as ſoon as you have drawn them, put them into a convenient Baſket with ſome fine Mold, and haſten them to the Ground where they are to be ſet, for the ſooner they are ſet the better they proſper.</p>
               <p>The Ground they beſt thrive in, muſt be very rich, warm and a deep Soil, digged two Spades grafts and two wovelings alſo; and when it is raked and laied very even, then draw very ſtreight Lines, or Furrows, trod out in long Beds about four Foot broad, from one end of your Work unto the other, ſet them about one Foot aſunder every way, and if it be a dry Spring, they muſt be kept

watering till they recover their fading wan Complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>You may begin to dig your Ground in the beginning of Winter, and ſo all along, to the time of ſetting, weed it and hoe it till it have got the maſtery of the Weeds, and then it will deſtroy them: Set them by a Line for a good evenneſs with a Setting-ſtick, crumbling in light Mold to fill up the vacancy, and if any die you muſt fill up the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy, for they come not to their natural perfection un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der three Years, and the firſt and ſecond Year keep them hoing, and you may gather Sets from them almoſt as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny as you have ſet, for the Root will bear it, by taking firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Ground, and well ſpreading; ſo that theſe Sets will in the mean time ſupply other Grounds.</p>

               <p>INcloſures and Wood-land are of great advantage to the Huſbandman, not only in ſupplying him with Timber for his own uſe in Building and Sale, but with Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood for Hedging, Fuel and the like, for himſelf and Neighbours, to encreaſe Encloſures and paſs away the bitter cold of the Winter with keeping good Fires; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Trees may be planted, and will flouriſh in places where Corn, or Graſs, or any other profitable thing will not kindly grow; beſides when the Lands are cleared of Woods they prove much better, and yield greater plenty of Corn, with a little Manure, than many that have been long tilled lying round about them; they alſo yield plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and delightful proſpects to the Eye, ſerve as cool ſhades to retreat in in the Summer, and in the Winter prove ſhelters to the Houſes, Barns and Lands lying near them, from the cold nipping Winds; and in Woods, by their warmneſs, Graſs in the vacant places ſprings all the

Year, on which Sheep will feed well and grow fat, being by that means preſerved from the cold and rot; likewiſe well grown Woods, in moſt places, produce Maſt, Holm, Acrons, Hazle-nuts, Services, Medlers and the like; which, either falling of themſelves, or being diligently beaten down, feed a great number of Swine to a conſiderable fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Lands of ſmall value may be, by planting of Trees, brought to grow up to conſiderable Eſtates; I find it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by ſeveral, that Land not computed to be worth ten Shillings an Acre <hi>per Annum,</hi> has by this manner of improvement produced, at eleven or twelve Years growth, as much Wood as was fell'd from one Acre 60 <abbr>

               <argument>
                  <p> Of Oak, Elm, and Beech, how to Order and Improve them for the beſt advantage.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Oak, among others, for firmneſs and durableneſs, it is counted the beſt Timber in the World for building Houſes, Shipping, and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary uſes, and yet it will grow in any indifferent Land, good or bad, as Clay, Gravel, Sand, mixed, or unmixed Soils, dry, cold, warm or moiſt, but they moſt affect, and beſt proſper in the ſound, black, deep Mold, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle riſing, rather warm than over moiſt and cold, for this produces the firmeſt and beſt Timber, though they will thrive very well in cold, moiſt Clay-grounds; they will alſo grow, though but ſlowly, on high, ſtony, and barren Hills, ſome ſow Acrons in their Nurſeries, when they are ripe, but not dried, and theſe produce ſtore of young Plants in the Spring, if ſowed in Autumn, which may be removed the next Year, and planted in forms for Groves, Woods, or Lawns; but I hold the Slips and Plants got from the roots of Oaks thriving, and of a moderate age, are better, and will much ſooner come to perfection, if planted and fenced from the brouzing of Cattle, the nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping northern Wind, whoſe unreaſonable cold in Winter does much hurt to young Plants; and if any of your Plants be crooked, or ill-ſhapen, cut thoſe near to the Ground, when you ſet them, and other Shoots will ſpring up from them, that will grow ſtraight, and become very aſpiring in time: Oaks likewiſe proſper very well in Copices, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to be felled as Under-wood; beſide the Wood of theſe Trees for various uſes, the Bark is of good value, and for Tanners and Dyers uſe, not to be omitted; nay, the Saw-duſt and Aſhes are of value; ſo that there is no loſs in any part of it, that is not proper for ſome uſe or
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:174183:65"/>
other; in Charcoal it is the beſt of all Wood, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures wet and dry to a long continuance.</p>
               <p>The next of uſe to this in <hi>England</hi> is the Elm, chiefly planted in Hedge-rows, caſting a good ſhade againſt the ſcorching of the Sun, and proving a notable ſhelter againſt cold Winds, growing much faſter than the Oak; it grows well in moſt Grounds that are not hot, dry, and parching, Chalk, Gravel, and ſhallow Lands, for in them its large ſpreading Roots cannot well enter, and it requiring much Sap will not otherwiſe thrive, or come to any ſtatelineſs of perfection: It delights moſtly in light, level, and looſe Land that is moiſt, and on the Banks of ſuch levels as are fertil Ground. The Seeds of the Elm, as they are termed, which put out before the Leaves, in open weather, fall about the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> which, ſome hold, being ſown in a Nurſery, will yield ſtore of young Plants; but I like thoſe better that ſpring out of the Ground from the ſpreading Roots, that lye ſhallow ſome diſtance from the Tree, a great many of which may be eaſily taken up with Spurns, and ſome part of the main Root upon them, and theſe are called Suckers, being, at the proper ſeaſons, to be had in abundance, and theſe you may tranſplant into any place where it is proper for Elins to grow.</p>
               <p>Take not thoſe Suckers that have been bitten, or bruiſed by Cattle, for they will not grow kindly, and theſe are eaſily tranſplanted with ſucceſs, ſeldom failing: If they be young, you need not cut off the tops, becauſe, being very ſappy, the wet will enter and decay the Plant; but, if of conſiderable growth, you may cut them as you pleaſe, making a ſtiff mixture of Clay and Horſe-dung to lay firm on the cut places to defend them from the decending Rain, which would otherwiſe ſoak into the Wood and injure the Plant. Some have a way, and with good ſucceſs, to remove large Elmes the quicklier, to make a ſhade about their Houſes, or ſhelter their Grounds, by opening the Earth about the Root of one of fifteen, ſixteen, or twenty Years growth, cutting off the ſpreading roots about a Foot and a half, and leaving only the ſtump-root to draw Sap up, then cover it again, and if it appear with no viſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, the next Year they remove it, when the Sap is well
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:174183:66"/>
riſing, and clap it into a Ground made better and more apt to receive it than where it firſt grew, ſetting the Root deep, and covering it with good Earth; ſo that pleaſant Groves of this have ſuddenly been erected where Trees have been ſcanty, to the great admiration of thoſe that have known the places bare a little before, and ſeen Trees of a ſtately growth flouriſhing, ſo that at firſt they could ſcarcely believe their Eyes and Senſes, it was the ſame place. This way is likewiſe eaſie to be taken by Willows and other light Wood, which will grow from great Poles without Coots, if ſet in agreeable moiſt places.</p>
               <p>The Elm is a Wood much laſting, wet or dry, and ſerves for a great many uſes, growing to a prodigious heighth, affording great ſtore of Fuel and Timber, and is beſt ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led between <hi>November</hi> and <hi>February,</hi> as being then all ſpine and heart, the Sap being gone down to the Root, and being very tough and laſting, it ſerves for the uſe of Wheel-wrights, Plough-wrights, making of Carts, Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Planks, Coffins, and many other uſes; the young Sprays are good for Cattle, Conies, or Deer to brouze on, and the bigger Boughs make good Charcoal, and as it is common, ſo it is of very great uſe.</p>
               <p>The next to this is Beech, formerly greatly in uſe for Building, delighting in warm Land, and growing to great ſtature, caſting a lovely ſhade, ſo that in former days it was uſually planted about Princes Palaces, though it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights moſt in the ſides and tops of high Hills, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the roots will wonderfully penetrate ſtony places.</p>
               <p>Where large Oak-Woods have been felled, Beech-Trees have been known to ſpring up in abundance, none grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there before. This is raiſed from the Maſt, as the Oak, and from young Plants, planted as the Oak; when young it grows but ſlow, but when it has got a head it mounts and ſpreads apace, none ſooner attaining to a large bulk than this Tree; and, though whilſt young, it may happen to be crooked, knotty, and ill-ſhapen, yet growing to a good body it will overcome theſe defects, and be ſtraight and a very compleat Tree.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:174183:66"/>This Wood is of great uſe for Joyners, Turners, Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holſterers, and formerly much uſed in building and floor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, being clean, white, not apt to rend, or ſplit; it is good Fuel, burning clear and light, making excellent good Charcoal, though not laſting; the Maſt of it ſeeds Deer, Swine, and many ſorts of Fowl, Pheaſants particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in it and grow fat upon it; the Wood, with fine Saws, being cut into Scabboard, or Scale-boards, very th n, ſerve for many uſes.

               </argument>
               <p>THe Aſh is another very profitable Tree for Timber and Fuel, being of a quick and thriving growth; it delights in good Land, though almoſt in any other it will thrive, as barren Mountains, Land hardly fit for any other uſe, but the much ſpreading of the roots where they ſtand, near Arable Land, hinders the Plough, and the Water dropping from them much injures the Corn; but Woods, Coppices, Waſtes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be repleniſhed with them, they uſually growing better where other Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber has been fell'd, or decay'd by a long growth.</p>
               <p>In White and Chalky Land they proſper very well, as it appears by thoſe of a very large ſtature growing on ſuch Lands in <hi>Wiltſhire, Hampſhire,</hi> and other Counties in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> the Lops and Timber turning to a very great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:174183:67"/>Theſe Trees may be propagated of the Keys ſown, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in <hi>October,</hi> or after, when they are about falling off from the moſt thriving Trees: Theſe may be ſowed in a Nurſery, and the Spring come twelve-month they will be fit to tranſplant to ſuch places as you deſign for a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued growth; but this, as of all other Trees, is a ſlow way, and therefore I adviſe rather to get young Sets of a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſize, and cut not off the young tops, becauſe they are very ſappy, if it be of the Seed, but if of the young Plants, you may cut them near the Ground, and if they take good root, as they will ſoon do, you need not fear but they will ſend up young Shoots and grow apace; and if any of them be grown up, and decay, if you cut them near the Ground they will revive and ſprout up with more ſpeed, and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh exceedingly.</p>
               <p>If you intend to have a Grove of Aſh on a Hill, or in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Ground, ſet the Seeds in rows with a Setting-ſtick, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Ground has been lightly broke up, let them be at ſome diſtance, and many Seeds in a hole, that ſome may infallibly hit; and without tranſplanting, they will in a few Years ſpring to a good heighth; but if many Plants come up in one place, remove the underlings, that the main Plant may grow the freer, by being diſencumbred; but beware that Cattle deſtroy them not when young. You may plant them among other Trees that are grown pretty well, to defend them from their brouzings, and from the biting cold.</p>
               <p>The uſe of this Wood is almoſt general, is proper in Building, where ſeaſoned, or well dried; it ſtands the Plow-wright and Wheel-wright in great ſtead; Coopers and Turners are much profited by them for Poles; it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent either for the ſupporting Hops, or any aſpiring things that cannot, without help, ſupport themſelves, and ſerves the Huſbandman and Gardiner for many Tools and and Utenſils; it is uſed in many things about Shipping, and in Maritime Utenſils; as for Fuel, it burns ſweet, wet, or dry, leaving curious white Aſhes behind them, and little earthy parts: The Leaves ſtamped, and laid to the bite of any venomous Beaſt, draws out the Poyſon; and with ſucceſs the Juice of the Leaves are drank againſt any Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon inwardly received.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:174183:67"/>The Seaſon for ſetting the Aſh, for the beſt growth, is from the end of <hi>October,</hi> or beginning of <hi>November,</hi> till <hi>January;</hi> for if the Sap at ſetting be but a little in the Tree, the Worm takes it and hinders the growth very much, ſpoiling in the end the Timber. I have been cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly informed, that an Aſh at forty Years growth from the Key, or Seed, has been ſold ſtanding, for thirty Pounds, and the Perſon who bought it got ten Pounds by it, when cut out into Timber and Fuel.</p>
               <p>As for the Walnut, Cheſnut, and Service-Trees, they are proper to the Woods, yet bear Fruit very advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the owner.</p>
               <p>As for the Walnut, it grows beſt on Hills, where the Ground is tollerably good, in a curious Sandy, or Gravel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Soil; and, beſide the Fruit that is delicious and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, making good Oyl for ſundry uſes, the Wood is of great eſteem for Gun-ſtocks, Cabinets, In-laying, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things. This Tree grows of Sets, or Nuts, to a prodigious bigneſs, though it riſes not ſo faſt as the Aſh; and if you deſign their propogation by Nuts, after you have laid them to ſweat, enter them in Sand, and at a Month's end put them into Water, and thoſe that ſwim lay aſide as uſeleſs, but ſuch as ſink, dry them and lay them in Sand a Month more, and then, in the beginning of the Spring, ſet them, and they thrive beſt unmoved, therefore ſet them at a diſtance one from another, and when they grow up fit for tranſplanting, if occaſion require it, mark the quarters of the Winds, as they ſtand, on the Bark, and place them, when removed, directly the ſame way; ſlips may be taken from the Roots of the growing Walnut-Trees as they are well-ſpringing up, with ſome little of the Root and Bark with them, and ſet in Sandy, or a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Soil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Cheſnut-Tree was formerly very flouriſhing in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> as appears by many eminent ancient Buildings, whoſe Timber moſtly conſiſts of that Wood, being very firm and durable. Theſe may be raiſed from Nuts as the former, <hi>viz.</hi> ſpread them when they are ſo ripe that they drop from the Tree, and let them ſweat a while, then uſe them, in all reſpects, as the Walnut, ſet them at a diſtance
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:174183:68"/>
in a mixed Soil, for they thrive beſt unmoved. You may ſet them in Winter or Autumn, in or without their huſks, or you may ſow them with other Maſt for the raiſing of Copices.</p>
               <p>It is a very thriving Tree, producing extraordinary good Poles for divers neceſſary uſes, and in ten or twelve Years time grow to a kind of Timber, and bear plenty of Nuts. This Timber, for durance and ſervice, is next to Oak; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing planted in Hedge-rows, or Avenues, it yields a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ſhade and ornament.</p>
               <p>The Service-Trees are raiſed from the Berries, as other Maſt may be, which, being ripe, may be ſown as other Maſt, and they will grow apace; or you may draw young Plants in Woods where they are overſhaded by other, more ſpreading Trees, and cannot w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Birch is another Tree very uſeful and profitable, and will grow almoſt on any Land, ſo that barren Land may be much improved by it: It will thrive on hot burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sand, in cold moiſt Clay, and in marſhy Ground, Boggy, or Stony places; this is properly produced by Suckers, which may be planted at five or ſix Foot diſtance, and they will grow a great pace, riſing, as it were, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly to Trees; after the firſt Year they may be cut with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in an Inch of the Ground, and they will ſhoot out very ſtrongly. This Tree yields excellent Sap in great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, and being prepared with Honey, or Sugar, into a Wine, is very medicable, as well as a pleaſant innocent Liquor, called Birch-wine.</p>
               <p>It may be extracted by cutting ſome ſmall Branches when the Sap riſes, in the end of <hi>February</hi> and beginning of <hi>March,</hi> the Weather being open, and eſpecially when the Wind is at South, or Weſt, hanging Bottles at the cut Branches to receive the criſtaline Liquor; or you may bore the Tree and tap it; and by this means you may get great quantities, it flowing forth very freely. The ſmall Branches of this Tree turn to great advantage in making

               <p>The Maple. This requires a dry and ſound Mold, growing in Hedge-rows very well, as alſo in Woods and Groves; it may be propagated by Sets, or the Keys of the Aſh. The Timber is much eſteemed for its whiteneſs, and the Diaper-knots found in it ſerving for Trenchers, Bowls, and many other Utenſils, and much eſteemed in Joyner's Work.</p>
               <p>Horn-beam much affects the open parts of Woods, and ſet in Walks or Avenues, produces a pleaſant ſhade. It will grow indifferently on any Soil, it muſt be ſet deep, and the Sets may be about two Inches in compaſs in the middle; it may likewiſe be raiſed of thoſe Seeds that are ripe in <hi>Auguct,</hi> if ſown in <hi>October:</hi> But ſince moſt Woods yield ſufficient Plants, I like the ſetting them beſt, for the greater expedition. The Timber is very hard, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore uſeful for Wheel-wrights, or making Tools for Rural uſes.</p>
               <p>Quick-beam proſpers beſt in good light Ground, though it delights in Mountains and Woods; Plant the young Sets as the former, or it will grow from the Berries that are found ripe about the middle of <hi>October;</hi> it grows apace in Woods and Coppices, yielding excellent Fuel, and is good for divers other uſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:174183:69"/>The Hazle, though of great value for the Nuts, yet is a Wood-tree, affecting, above others, dry, barren, and cold ſandy Ground; likewiſe Rocky and Mountainous Soils produce them, though they thrive much better in Hedge-rows, where the Sun has power to invigorate them.</p>
               <p>This Tree is properly raiſed from the Nut, preſerved moiſt, but not moldy; and to do it, you may lay them in their own dry Leaves, or in Sand: Theſe ought to be ſet about the latter end of <hi>February;</hi> but, as in the caſe of all other Trees, young Sets, or Suckers, will ſooneſt grow; but cut not theſe the firſt Year, but the Spring following, within three or four Inches of the Ground, that is, if your Sets be ſmall; but greater Sets may, the firſt Year, be cut within ſix Inches of the Ground.</p>
               <p>The Hazle, though it ſeldom grows to ſubſtantial Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, is yet very profitable for the bearing of Nuts, for the feeding of Swine, and pleaſant for the Food of Man, out of which, is likewiſe extracted a curious Oyl.

When the Nut-trees flower much, it is a ſign of a plentiful Corn-harveſt.</p>
               <p>The Box-tree is of a great uſe, though of ſlow growth; it will grow on any indifferent Land, and is encreaſed by ſlips; it keeps green all the Year, and gives a very pleaſant proſpect; the Wood is of ſingular uſe, and bears a great price, being uſually ſold by weight: So that a Grove of well-grown Box of ſix Acres has been ſold for 3000 <abbr>

               <p>The Juniper-tree covets to grow on hilly and gravelly Ground, the Wood, Leaf, and Berries, are medicina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; it may be ſowed of the Berry, or ſet of ſmall Slips; it laſts green all the Winter, and in burning caſts a curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſcent: It is proper to make fine Boxes, Cabinets, and other curious Works; the Scent of it keeps away Worms and Moths; its Gums, or the ſweating of it, is good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt pains in the Stomach, or Heart, and prevents infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Air.</p>

                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:174183:69"/>Holly is a tough Wood, keeps green all the Year, and carries on it in Winter, a curious red Berry, it thrives in any indifferent Ground, and may be ſet by Slips, or Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; the Wood, if large, yields a good price.</p>
               <p>The Lime-tree muſt be planted in an indifferent rich Soil, for it will not thrive in hungry, cold, dry Land; it is raiſed as Suckers from the Elm, or from Seeds, or Berries that drop in Autumn from the Trees, and theſe are moſtly uſed for ornament in Walks, caſting a lovely ſhade, though in Woods they grow a good pace, and yield Timber, Pole, and ſtore of good Fuel.</p>
               <p>The Yew-tree may be propagated in any barren Ground, even on the blackeſt Hills or Mountains, it being hot by nature, producing a curious red Berry, luſhious, and ſweet as Honey, though the Stone, or Seed, of it be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bitter; and theſe Berries put into the Ground, will grow, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The Fir and Pine, being naturally hot, delight in cold Grounds, high and rocky Hills and Mountains; they will be raiſed by the Kernel taken out of the Clogs, or Pine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apples, ſoaked in Water, and then expoſed to a gentle warmth; theſe you may ſow in a Nurſery, or where you intend they ſhall grow up to a Grove, or Wood, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Pine, which will hardly bear a remove, unleſs ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry young, though the Fir may be very eaſily removed, and propagated on Slips, and will grow ſmall and ſtreight, to a prodigious heighth, if it take good root, even to ſixty Foot high in twenty Years growth, though in the ſix Years they ſeem not to grow very faſt, but afterward ſhoot up exceedingly.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THus, Reader, having declared what is neceſſary for the improvement of dry barren Lands, by planting the moſt uſeful Trees for Timber and other ſervices, I think it fit, in the ſame manner, to inſtruct you to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove wet, boggy, and otherways uſeleſs Lands, by plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Trees to yield great ſtote of advantage by Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Poplar, a Tree well known, grows exceeding well in moiſt Grounds, near the brinks of Rivers, but not in the Water, as the Willow; this Tree is propagated by ſtreight Branches, or Pitchers, ſet in the Ground; but beware you cut not off the tops till they are of two or three Years growth, and head them at eight or ten Foot high, and in a few Years their Branches will ſpread ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly. The Timber is white, and of ſingular uſe for Turners work, and to make Tools for the Huſband-man; and beſides its pleaſant ſhade it yields abundance of Fuel.</p>
               <p>The Aſpen-tree delights in moiſt, wet Ground, though it will grow in Woods and Copices; it differs not much from the Poplar, and is propagated by young Suckers, whoſe tops you muſt not cut off the firſt Year.</p>
               <p>The Alder may, with ſucceſs, be ſet in wet Lands, and much improves it; of theſe you may ſet Trunchions, and they will grow very faſt, they will alſo grow of Seeds, but the beſt are young Sets with roots, being ſet as big as the ſmall of a Man's Leg, and in length about two Foot; cut not the ſmaller Sets till they have ſtood three Years, and ſo they will produce great ſtore of Wood for Poles and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſes.</p>

                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:174183:70"/>The Withe is a good improver of boggy Land, as alſo the Oſier, which turns to a very great advantage, being worth 9 or 10 <abbr>

               </argument>
               <p>THere remain yet other things not treated of in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the improvement of Land by Trees, <hi>viz.</hi> As for ſuch Trees as caſt their Leaves in the Fall, the beſt time to tranſplant them, to other convenient places, for Timber, Under-wood, Shade, or Ornament, you may do it, the Weather being open, in <hi>October, November,</hi> and, upon neceſſity, till they begin to bud, in the Spring; and thoſe Trees that do not ſhed their Leaves, but are green throughout the Year, are beſt removed in the Spring, when the cold is abated and the Sun opens the pores of the Earth, that the Roots may ſpread, and the Sap be continued by freſh moiſture; and it may be well done in <hi>August.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:174183:71"/>The pithy Trees, as the Aſh, Lime-trees, Sycamore, Aſpen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> need no cutting, upon tranſplanting, till they have well taken root one Year; and then, to haſten their growth in bigneſs, you may cut the tops of the uppermoſt branches that too luxuriouſly expend the moiſture that ſhould feed the bole and under-branches. As for Fir, or any Roſiny-tree, cut not the roots, nor the branches, but a very little, becauſe they will be apt to ſpread their Roſin, or Turpentine, too much, to the decay of the Plant, for that is it which keeps it alive and and makes it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper.</p>
               <p>This method may be uſed to tranſplant Suckers, Scions, Slips, or Layers, of Birch, Elm, Cheſnut, Oak, Beech, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But where they have not good root, it muſt be done in the Spring, when the Sap is riſen, and they begin to put out their buds. All Trees delighting in wet, or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Ground, may well be tranſplanted in <hi>February,</hi> or <hi>March,</hi> before they are too forward, if the Froſt be well out of the Ground.</p>
               <p>Remove Trees rather into a better than a worſer Ground wherein they naturally grew, or, at leaſt, ſo much good Earth in the holes you make to ſet them in, as may firſt give them a fixed rooting, and ſo they may get a head, and when they are once acquainted with the nature of the Land they will thrive amain; let as much of the Earth in which they firſt grew, as may be, adhere to the root when you remove them, that ſo they may be the better nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and grow more kindly, and let the ſpurns of the roots be, as many as may be, pretty long and large, except the top and downright roots, that ſo they may ſpread every way; and, that they may the better do it, make the holes you ſet them in large, and fill in the Mold looſe upon them.</p>
               <p>If you would have your Trees proſper well, remove them not out of a warm ſhelter into a bleak, cold Air; and, to keep them ſteady and upright, that they may not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, nor much looſen by the blowing of Winds, keep the Earth pretty high about them above the level of the Ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:174183:71"/>The Oak, Pine, Walnut, and other Trees, that bear ſpreading branches, at the tranſplanting, ſet at a good diſtance from each other, at leaſt forty Foot; but the Beech, Aſh, Yew, Fir, and Cheſnut, may ſtand much nearer, <hi>viz.</hi> at a third of the diſtance. The Hornbeam and Elm, will grow the neareſt of any Trees together, and theſe you may plant in a regular, or a promiſcuous order.</p>
               <p>As for the watring of Trees in dry Seaſons, care muſt be had of it whilſt they are young, eſpecially as ſoon as they are tranſplanted, for this ſettles the Earth about them, and makes the Roots take firmer hold, and if they have been far fetched, ſet the Roots in Water ſome time before you plant them, and if you find the Wind much ſhakes them, ſet ſtrong Stakes by them, and faſten the Trees to thoſe Stakes with wiſps of Hay, that they may the better be ſtrengthned, and ſo order it, by putting Moſs, or Hay, between the Plants, that the rubbing may not fret, or gaul them; you may lay about the Roots of them, Fern, Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Hawme, or any other ſuch like things, that, in the firſt place, it may keep them warm, and, in rooting, dung them: Stones laid about the Roots of Trees, keep them moiſt in Summer, and warm in Winter: Coppices may be planted about Autumn with young Sets, or Plants, the beſt way in rows, at ten or fifteen Foot diſtance, for then you may very well reap the benefit of Intervals, by ploughing, digging, and ſowing, and have a great deal the better conveniency for the grazing of Cattle, and proper ways for Wains, or Carts, to fetch away the Timber, or paſs from one Ground to another; beſides, it will yield you pleaſant ſhady Walks; and then, if you would thicken your Coppice, when well grown, bend ſome of the Boughs that are neareſt to the Ground, give them little nicks on the back of the bending, and put them a little way ſo bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Earth, covering them with Mold, and keeping them from riſing with hooked Stakes driven into the Ground, and, ſpringing up, they will produce a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Suckers, and, in time grow up into Trees, or, at leaſt, conſiderable Under-woods.</p>

                  <p> How to Order Trees for their better growing and more ſpeedily turning to good Advantage.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>TO preſerve Trees in good plight, and to make them grow apace, there are other things required, than what I have hitherto mentioned.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Prune them, when they are ſomewhat well grown, taking off with your Pruning-hook, the ſmalleſt, and moſt ſuperfluous Boughs and Branches, doing it upward, about <hi>January,</hi> that what of the Snag remains to the Tree may not ſplit; and the beſt way is to cut them off as cloſe to the Body of the Tree as may be, leſt the Stump rot, and Water get into the hollow part to ſpoil and doat the Timber.</p>
               <p>Secondly, When you perceive your Plants will not grow up to tall Timber, ſhroud them, or lop them, and they will grow up to be very good Pollards: This muſt be done above the heighth of the reach of Cattle, ſmooth, and aſloap, taking off the top and main Branches; this may be done in the beginning of the Spring, or the end of the Fall, and ſo, when they are grown up, you may lop them every four or five Year for good Fuel; beſides, theſe may ſtand in Hedge-rows, or vacant places, fit for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſe, and, after they have afforded you great ſtore of it, the Bodies, if they hold ſound, make a good ſort of ſhort Timber, very fit for Planks, and other uſes. As for Winter-greens, as Pines, or any other roſinous Tree, they muſt be cut in Winter, after the great Froſts, and coldeſt Winds are over; but in no wiſe be beheaded, nor the colateral Branch much cut off.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, All Trees delighting in wet, or moiſt Ground, may be ſhrouded, or lopped, in the beginning of <hi>March,</hi> the Weather being open, but not too near the Body, leſt it endanger the Tree, and hinder its ſprouting.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:174183:72"/>Fourthly, Coppices may be felled, or cut, from <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> to mid-<hi>March,</hi> leaving ſuch ſtandards, as you intend for Timber, at an equal diſtance, chuſing out the ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and moſt likely thriving, for that purpoſe; cut not above half a Foot from the Ground, and that ſloap-wiſe, that the young Sprigs may the better ſhoot out, and grow, and furniſh you with a ſecond Felling.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, When your Timber-trees are arrived at their beſt ſtate, or you have occaſion to fell them for advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, fell the Oak from <hi>April</hi> till Mid-ſummer, for then the Sap is proud, and the Bark, which is a very good Commodity, will eaſfily be got off: But for other Timber, the beſt Seaſon is in Winter, when the Sap is low; for if it be much in thoſe Trees, it breeds Worms, and much defaces the beauty of it: and the propereſt Months, are <hi>December,</hi> and <hi>January;</hi> when you fell large Timber, cut off all the large Arms firſt, leſt they endanger the Tree, rifling, or breaking in the fall.</p>

                     <hi>Of Trees fitting for Timber and other <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſes; the ſundry ſorts; their goodneſs, and to what uſes properly to be attributed; very neceſſary to be known,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Shall now, from what has already been laid down, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the uſefulneſs of the Timber and Wood produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Trees, that have not as yet been amply touch'd on.</p>
               <p>Cedar and Cypreſs are excellent in Building, for their laſtingneſs; as not, in a great number of Years, being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to corrupt.</p>
               <p>The Fir, Poplar, Aſh, and Elm, are exceeding good for the inward parts of Building; as for main Timber, Jouſts, Rafters, Floors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but hold not ſo well where they are ſometimes wet, and at other times dry, as the Oak does.</p>
               <p>For the conveyance of Water, the Alder, Pine, Pitch-tree, and Elm, make curious and laſting Pipes; but then they muſt be covered with Earth, for above Ground they will not well hold, eſpecially in hot Weather, by reaſon of their rining; eſpecially all but the laſt, which will do tollerably well.</p>
               <p>The Oak, Beech, and Walnut-tree, endure very well in the Water. The wild-Olive, Maſt-holm, and wild-Oak, are of long endurance.</p>
               <p>For Rafters and Mortice-pieces, the Elm and Aſh are very properly adapted, becauſe of their length: The beſt to bear wieght is the Fir, and the Laraſh; which, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you lay them, will neither bend, nor fail your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation till Worms conſume them. On the contrary,</p>
               <p>The Olive and the Oak will give and bend, and ſo will the Poplar: The Wilow, Birch, Elm, and Date, uſually
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:174183:74"/>
bend againſt the burthen they bear; the Poplar, on the other ſide, giveth upon every light weight; the Elm, and the Aſh, though ſlow, are eaſily bent.</p>
               <p>Theſe are eaſily wound and bent, <hi>viz.</hi> The Willow and Birch, and the ſmaler Oak; Shingles to cover Houſes are beſt made of Oak, Beech, and the Wood of ſuch other Trees as bear Maſt; alſo of ſuch as yield Roſin, as the Pine, and the Pitch-tree.</p>
               <p>For Tables, Stands, Bowls, and ſuch other houſhold Utenſils, the Maple, Aſh, and Walnut, are very curious, graceful <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woods, and much laſting.</p>
               <p>Box is a Wood well known, of great value for its firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and durableneſs, and uſually ſold, for its preciouſneſs, by weigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>; and ſerves for Combs, Hafts of Knives, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical Inſtruments, and ſo many Mechanical uſes, that little, except the very tender Sprays, can be counted waſte in it; ſo that an Acre of good growth of this is held to exceed, by much, the value of twenty Acres of the beſt Corn; and therefore, conſidering when once it is well got in the Ground, that every twenty Years it may be well cut, and the Roots left will produce new Shoots to ſupply the place of what was taken away, what great advantage may be made by it, in improving Land where little elſe will grow, and that it requires no yearly toiling, ploughing, and ſowing, nor the charge of Seed.</p>
               <p>Holly is another excellent Wood, uſeful for Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocks, Cops of Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p> Wonderful Improvement of Land, by planting Trees, and by Incloſures; ſhewing the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of it over thoſe Lands that lye in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>WOod may be greatly improved, by incloſing Ground with it, for Corn and Paſture; yielding a great many advantages to the painful Huſband-man, whoſe good Induſtry well deſerves a good Recompence.</p>
               <p>Firſt, For that well-grown Trees, and good Hedge-rows, ſhelters his tender Corn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from bleak Winds; and keeps off the blaſtings that would much annoy it, even when grown.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is a great advantage to Paſture-lands, in ſheltering Cattle, both in the heat of Summer, and in the extream of Winter; as alſo from violent ſtorms of Rain, Hail, or Snow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, It ſecures Corn from High-roads being made into it by idle Perſons and Cattle; which, if it lay in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, or open, could not be avoided, ſince thoſe, that know not the toil and coſt the Huſbandman is at, to bring his Crop to a Harveſt, little regard what havock they make, through lazineſs, for wanton diſportment, or the neareſt way; which, if there were a Barrier of good Fence, they could not do: and then for Cattle, it ſaves the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Pounding, and many frivilous Suits, that frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ariſe on treſpaſſes of theſe kinds; and therefore is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious both to the owner of the one and the other,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:174183:75"/>Fourthly, Trees growing up, their Lops afford much Fuel and Fencing, perpetually ſupplying the owner with both, as occaſion requires; and indeed few know the ſcarcity of the firſt, ſo well as thoſe that live diſtant from Incloſures, in open champion Countries, where Coals can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not at all, or at leaſt, without great charge and labour, be had; not only the pinching Winters afflict theſe, but even their neceſſary occaſions, of Brewing, Baking, and Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their Proviſion, make them ſenſible, to their great coſt and loſs of time, that the planting of Trees is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly beneficial, for that, being at hand, they may keep it in a readineſs, by getting it in, and laying it up to dry, at leaſure times, to their great comfort and advantages; and be profited in ſelling the overplus, to the rich, and charitably beſtowing ſome on their poor Neighbours; and, for their Chriſtian Compaſſion towards them, be loaded with their Bleſſings and Prayers: and of this, one Mr. <hi>Tuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer,</hi> one very much experienced in Rural Affairs, in his old faſhioned Rhime thus ſpeaks:

                     <l>For nothing of Wealth it doth raiſe,</l>

                     <l>In Wood-lands the poor Man that have,</l>
                     <l>ſcarce fully ten Acres in Land,</l>
                     <l>More merrily live, and do ſave,</l>
                     <l>than th'other with forty in Land,</l>
                     <l>The one hath, in every Hedge,</l>
                     <l>both plenty of Fuel and Fruit;</l>
                     <l>The other lays Turf up and Sedge,</l>
                     <l>and gets it by wonderous ſuit;</l>
                     <l>And ready in Winter to ſtarve,</l>
                     <l>when th'other you ſee doth not ſo,</l>
                     <l>But has what is needful to ſerve,</l>
                     <l>when th'other all ragged does go.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:174183:76"/>There is, indeed, a great difference in the advantage ariſing between Incloſures, or Wood-lands, and ſuch as lye open; and though ſome may be apt to grudge at the incloſing of Commons, yet, were there a good meaſure taken therein, it would greatly turn to the advantage of the poor, and much improve the riches of the Nation; there being ſo much good Land, lying as it were waſte, might be incloſed and let to the benefit of the poor; to the great eaſing of the Pariſhes, and advantaging thoſe that claim a right therein, three or four times more than what now it can; for the poor having little ſtock to put there, the rich make their advantage, who have much; which, if it was incloſed, and let out for the general bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, they could not do; and ſo thereby the ſtock of Corn would be greatly advanced; and, in ſome Years, a good improvement of Timber might be made, many Commons and Moors, that now lye in a manner waſte, and are of little profit, being capable, with a little induſtry, of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing equal with Lands of a good value; ſo that things thus rightly ſtated, every one concern'd might have a right underſtanding, and be highly ſatisfied in ſo good a Work.</p>
               <p>Conſider, in this caſe, where the Grounds are incloſed, how happily people live; as in <hi>Hartford-ſhire, Eſſex, Kent, Berk ſhire, Surry, Wilt ſhire, Somerſet-ſhire, Hamp-ſhire,</hi> and others; all which not only raiſe Corn for themſelves, but ſupply other open Countries, and even the great City of <hi>London,</hi> which conſumes a vaſt quantity thereof; and yet no parts of <hi>England</hi> ſet a greater rate, or make a greater advantage by Grazing.</p>
               <p>Therefore I muſt ſay, that all Intereſts upon Commons, or Rights of Common-paſture upon any of theſe Lands, may, without prejudice to any particular Intereſt, be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged, and much improvement made to the Publick, conſidering what vaſt quantities of Land lye, as I may term it, waſte; ſome over-run with Mole-hills, Ant-hills, Goſs, Fern, Bryers, Twitch-graſs, and the like; others under Water, for the want of opening the Currents, and Paſſages for Brooks, or Water, deſcending from Hills; for, whilſt it lyes thus, every one concludes it not
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:174183:76"/>
his buſineſs, and ſo it lyes neglected; and many however, claim their part in it, that will beſtow neither coſt nor labour in making it fit for good Paſture, or Corn-land; though, if it was ſo ordered, it might prove in a little time, the enriching of them, and be a means to diſburden the Pariſh, by the Rents ariſing therefrom, of the charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Poor, and be a means to employ labouring Men; ſo that every one would live at eaſe from encumbrances, or ſuffering wants.</p>
               <p>But this, ſome may ſay, cannot be done without great encouragement of our Superiors, or, at leaſt, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſent of all that have any right or claim in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parts of ſuch Land by long cuſtom. Suppoſe this grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as for the firſt, Thoſe that are called together, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the good and welfare of all the People of <hi>England,</hi> cannot be thought to be averſe to ſo great an advantage to the Publick, where Particulars are rightly repreſented and ſtated; ſince the Poor, reaping the Benefit, they being by far the vaſter number, it would be a great eaſement to the Nation, in employing many, and charitably ſupporting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: And, for the latter, I preſume, there are few, that would not be induced to ſtudy their own good and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>

                     <hi>Of Incloſures, and Trees planted in Hedge-rows, both Fruit, and others; and the benefit ariſing thereby to the Owners of ſuch Land,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THere might be abundance of things ſaid in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of Incloſures and Woodland, benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to private Perſons, and the general good of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſince ſo great a conſumption of Timber, and Under-wood has of late been made, in building of Shipping, Houſes, in Iron-works, and Charcoal; which, if not in time repaired, will make this, or at leaſt the next Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration too ſenſible of the decay of it; and the want of theſe Neceſſaries, will much obſtruct the Trade of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as put private Perſons to great ſtreights.</p>
               <p>The Earths proper in this caſe, may be choſen indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently; but for Wood land, chuſe a warm, ſandy, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velly Ground, mixed with other Earth to temper them, eſpecially with a moiſt, ſtrong, cold Clay.</p>
               <p>I have given divers Rules already for the meliorating Earths when they decay, or languiſh, by ſundry Manures, and therefore ſhall not be troubleſome to my Reader, in repeating what is already done; but where Incloſures are deſigned for Corn, by the way, that it is proper you make choice of a good, ſound, middle, warm Land, than of the richeſt, and fatteſt that is, and it will produce a great encreaſe, and the Timber about it will pretty well thrive, and grow up in time to great ſpreading Trees, though not over high, ſo that the Boughs will be very thick and ſubſtantial, and the great Arms ſerve for divers ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary uſes, as occaſion ſhall require them in Building, or other Matters; and the Spray-lops provide a ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Fuel to ſkreen you from the cold: In the Hedge-rows you may likewiſe, to advantage yourſelf more, plant
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:174183:77"/>
Fruit-trees, which being well grown, will, with a little care, bear better than thoſe planted in Orchards, as ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more open to the Sun, and altogether unincumbred by others; ſo that by the Fruit great profit will accrue, and the due pruning them will add to your ſtock of Fuel; beſides, it will give a very pleaſant proſpect to the Ground, affording cool and delightful Umbrays in the Summer-ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>And this appears by Land already improved in this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in <hi>Hertford-ſhire, Worceſter-ſhire, Glouceſter-ſhire,</hi> and other Countries; redownding to the great benefit of the Owners, who have, by this means, a double Crop yearly, one of Fruit, and the other of Corn, and a third may, in ſome caſes, be brought to perfection; <hi>viz.</hi> of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neps, or ſuch like, that may be ſown, ripe, and drawed, before the Seaſon for ſowing Barly comes on; by which means Land may be improved to a great value, or if laid down for Meadow, or Grazing, nothing can be more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating to Cattle, than a Paſture fringed with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Trees, ſpreading their Branches, as I have hinted, to ſkreen, by ſheltering from Rain, Winds, Heat, or Cold.</p>
               <p>This I ſpeak to incourage Induſtry, and this Induſtry conſequently encreaſes Wealth, which always commands a plenty of what is neceſſary; and, being once gained, takes off much of the toil and labour Poverty impoſes on the needy; ſo that the Labour of youthful Years, may comfortably ſupply old Age; to do which, experience teaches us, it is very neceſſary.</p>
               <p>It is allowed by the moſt judicious, that ſhadineſs in Summer, and warmneſs in Winter, occaſion'd by Trees, much helps and betters the Land; for in ſuch Fields we find the earlieſt Graſs, and frequently the greateſt Swath and Burthen, and conſequently more Corn than in open places, expoſed to bleak Winds in Winter and Spring, and the Sun's hot Beams continually lying on, and parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in Summer, from Morning till Evening-tide: Hills indeed, may reaſonably keep off ſome Winds, and make them fly over the Champion-ground; but I cannot conceive we have any that caſt ſo large a Shade, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:174183:78"/>
in Summer, when the Sun, as it were, in a manner, runs burning over our Heads, that give any tollerable ſhelter from its Beams at Morning or Evening, which Trees, growing near about the Ground, will infallibly do, and in ſome parts, or places, all the day long to good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
               <p>This Ground will feed more Cattle, and ſooner fatten them, than that which lyes open and expoſed to the Weather; and certainly, where Trees are formerly plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and grow not too thick, none can ſee reaſon to the contrary of what is ſaid: As for Land, I know very much, if not moſt of it, that was worth not above ten Shillings an Acre, ſome leſs, now the Graſs of moſt of it thus encloſed, and planted, is three times advanced, or more, the Fruit growing in the Hedge-rows, and Avenues, over-paying the Rent, and the Crop entire to the Owner.</p>
               <p>But ſay the Land were worth twenty Shillings an Acre, or more, this will cauſe the Trees better to proſper, and produce a greater Crop, and the leſs coſt in manuring or ploughing may be beſtowed on it.</p>
               <p>If you ſet rows of Trees, either Fruit or others, in the middle of your Fields, at ſuch diſtance as not to hinder the Sun from bringing forth the Graſs, or ripening the Corn, it will yet turn to a greater advantage, as four, or ſix ſold, and make the Huſband-man, in a little time, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in his labour, and ſo much Land now of little worth may be very much improved; and if ſo it happen, that one Crop fails in a Year, it is not morally poſſible that both ſhould; and ſo one hitting, will, however, make you ſavers, and rather more, by a great deal, if it happen any thing to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Theſe things may be done without much toil, or coſt, and prove in a manner a recreation to the induſtrious Farmer, or his Servants, at leiſure hours; and Plants and Grafts may be had out of his own Nurſeries, or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, where the thick, growing together, encumber one another; and, for other Trees, every Wood, or over-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred Hedge-row, afford a ſufficient ſtore, or if a Man at firſt be unprovided, at little coſt he may be furniſhed; and then, having of his own, he may improve and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply

a few to greater numbers, till his encreaſe is ſufficient to ſupply himſelf, and others, to a very conſiderable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree. So that all things being well conſidered, thoſe that are deſirous to do well for themſelves, or for their Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, will hearken to what I have laid down, that ſo Wealth and Plenty may encreaſe to them, and, by ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they may incite others to imitate them.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p> Reaſons for Incloſures and Wooding of Land, both for the private and publick advantage; and the Objections made against them anſwered and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed in many convincing Particulars.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>HEre, to draw near a concluſion of the Subject-mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this Book, I come to anſwer a main Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt Incloſures, and ſhew the advantage of them; but, the more ſmoothly to come to it, I affirm, that very many Waſtes, Forreſts, Moors, and Common-fields, as they are now enjoyed, through the oppreſſion of the Rich, and ſloth and idleneſs of the Poor, and miſuſage of all, are of little advantage to the Publick, being Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monable at random; nay, whether they are not worſe than nothing, ſome Years yielding a little profit and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, which in other Years is clearly ſwept away, old Stock and all.</p>
               <p>I know, upon ſome Common-fields, the Poor are forced to more charges in keeping their Cows, Horſes, or Sheep, than would keep them in good Paſture, without any care or trouble, it being the daily buſineſs of one Perſon to tend two or three Cows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for fear of breaking into other Mens Grounds, and ſo occaſioning letigious Suits by treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, whilſt the party tending them, might, at indifferent Labour, earn more than the graſing in good Paſture would amount to, and prevent all fears and dangers, by being
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:174183:79"/>
encloſed within good Fences, not only of their ſtraying, but of troubleſome borderers on Commons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the Objections is, If this were not, how ſhould ſo many poor Men, Women, and Children, be imployed; now one Town maintains many great Families, and many Families live upon the Common, which then muſt ſhift, and go a begging?</p>
               <p>Now, that I may mannage this Objection to the purpoſe, the great <hi>Romera</hi> to this Improvement (all other Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſeeming to me, in compariſon to this, as nothing) moſt Men herein being much beclouded, and very many wiſe Men ſo charitably bewitched herewith, I muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore demand,</p>
               <p>Firſt, How theſe People live? Why, truly, in a very mean, low condition; at hunger and eaſe, for the moſt part; and for the beſt of them, they live an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, moiling, and drudging kind of Life; what they get, they ſpend; Plough, Sow, and Reap, and all to bring the Rear about, and well if they can make even at the Year's end; and this kind of miſerable living they ſeem to be contented with, becauſe they cannot better them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As aforeſaid, many of theſe People are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, but to loſs, and very great loſs too, when their Pains and Charges is far greater, in keeping their Cattle and Herds by Corn-fields, in the High-ways and Lanes, than that they might have them paſtured for.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, What are the People fitted for hereby? Why Idleneſs, and an averſion to Induſtry; and as it were ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der themſelves uſeleſs to the Publick, li ing altogether in ignorance, having little regard of their Souls or Body.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Now Incloſures will bring far more advantage, if ſome, by diviſions, would lay the Land both warm and dry; others by quick-ſetting and planting Woods of many ſorts, Fruit-trees for Perry, and Sider, or Garden-roots; improving ſome Lands by watering, others by draining; and again by Corn, upon perfect and compleat Tilth and Soiling, which none will wave, it always bringing great profit, which may be done by thoſe Hands, that are to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or no purpoſe employed on Commons: other Lands
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:174183:79"/>
might be improved, as I have already directed, by Flax, Hemp, Clover, or the like, and all other means held forth in this Diſcourſe, whereby they may be really ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to their Generation.</p>
               <p>And this I affirm, That many more People may be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed this way than now are, and to double advantage, and none but the oppreſſor can be grieved at it, or any way prejudiced; and for ſuch a one, it matters not.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Take a ſurvey of all Incloſures, and take in whole Countries, and you will find more Wealth, more People, and every thing more plenty.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, For thoſe who meerly live upon the Commons, if they have a proportion allowed them to themſelves, as all honeſt People deſire they ſhould, I am confident it would wean a great many from their idleneſs, and pilfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way of living, to do what work is neceſſary; out of which will ariſe Incloſures, and the profits accruing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by will give them ſuch an opportunity of full employment, that they will have a juſt cauſe to rejoyce at the happy change of their condition ſo much bettered.</p>
               <p>Now I grant, as it is but reaſonable I ſhould, that all Common cannot be aptly incloſed without prejudice to the Poor, who muſt be removed on that account, unleſs bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proviſion in the mean while can be made for them, and the few Cattle they have; which is to be conſidered but in a very few places, and may well be ſtinted, or limited, to a ſet number of Cattle, and ſuch a number too as the Land will maintain to the beſt advantage; this might in ſome few caſes help, but in the generality little avail; becauſe feeding barely to keep Cattle alive, is no great matter of advantage; but ſuch feeding where they may increaſe, thrive, and grow fat, is that which can beſt profit the Owners, and alſo the Publick; and this cannot be where Ground, that is but poor of itſelf, is over-ſtocked; for then, by penury and want, Diſeaſes get among Cattle, as Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rains, Rots, and abundance of others, which in a ſound well-manured, and plentiful Paſture are ſtrangers; ſo that, by ſuch Caſualties, a poor Man may at once loſe all he has to depend on, and ſo be brought to want and begge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry never, by his Labour, in his life-time perhaps, being
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:174183:80"/>
able to recover the loſs of one fatal Year. And ſo, hoping none, from the higheſt to the loweſt, will have cauſe to cavel at theſe things, eſpecially if time be taken rightly to digeſt and conſider the Propoſitions as they ought, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude theſe Points, and proceed to other Matter that may be advantagious to the induſtrious Farmer, and others, who take any pleaſure to delight, or advance their own Intereſt in Rural Affairs; for, intending to make the Book a ſufficient Guide to all, I purpoſe to omit nothing, that may in any tolerable manner be conceived reaſonable to profit any, it being a Work indeed that was never before compacted to any purpoſe, in one Body, and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now reduced to ſo ſmall a Volume, it cannot but prove graceful to thoſe more particularly whoſe curioſity, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry leads them any thing this way, and may be a main Inſtrument to ſtir up Publick Spirits, to conſider the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good and Welfare of the Nation, in imploying their Purſes and Skill in promoting what conſequently will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly produce Riches and Plenty.</p>
               <p>Reader, <hi>I ſhall here a little further treſpaſs upon you, to let you know how to take or deſtroy other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures than what I have mentioned, that are great Enemies to Corn and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder-woods, Clear-waters,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>which may turn to your profit and pleaſure, in the proper Seaſons, after your Toil and Labour.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How to take the Stag, Buck, Hare, Fox, Badger, Wild-Goat, and Otter, which deſtroy Corn, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderwoods,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE Stag is the moſt Princely of all Games; and when you go about this, to know whether he be old or young, obſerve the Prints of his Feet where he has tracked the ſoft Ground; and, if it be large, with a thick Heel, open Cleft, long Space, and a deep Print, he is certainly old; but, if the contrary, you may venture upon him for a young one.</p>
               <p>And the principalleſt Quality being to know at all Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons where to find this Game, obſerve this Rule, <hi>viz.</hi> In <hi>November,</hi> ſeek among the Whines, thick Shrubs, or Turfs; in <hi>December,</hi> in thick Woods; in <hi>January,</hi> he is likelieſt to be found in the Corn-fields; in <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March,</hi> among the thick young Buſhes; in <hi>April</hi> or <hi>May,</hi> in Copices, or near Springs; in <hi>June</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> in Out-woods, and the Purlews on the Edges of Corn-fields; in <hi>September</hi> and <hi>October,</hi> after the firſt Falling-ſhowers, he goes to rutt.</p>
               <p>When you are in ſearch of him, go againſt the Wind, that he may not ſcent you, and haſtily remove. Sun-riſe is the beſt time to find him, when, having watched him to his Lare, you may aſſuredly find him there till the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, unleſs rouſted by ſome Affrightment.</p>
               <p>As for the manner of hunting him: When you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach ſomewhat near, ſend out your Finders; and when they have hunted about a Ring or two, caſt in the reſt of your Hounds, and chear them with your Horn and Voice, when they are at Full Cry on the Main Chaſe; and take ſpecial notice of the Stag, that you may know him, if your Dogs ſhould follow a wrong Game, that you may call them off, and ſet them back to their Default, making
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:174183:81"/>
them caſt about again till the firſt Game is again under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, and then chear them as before; and have a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Eye he beat not up another Stag; for the Stag hunted, being imboſſed and wearied, will, if he can, beat up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and, lying down, ſkulk cloſely in his place.</p>
               <p>You may perceive when he is weary, by his ſlavering and frothing of his Mouth, much Sweat, ſhining and blackneſs of his Hair, and often lying down; and for his laſt Refuge, he will betake himſelf to Ponds, Brooks, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, or any Stream, out of which he muſt be forced by Strength or Policy; and ſo you having the Game you ſought for, are at the end of hunting him.</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Of the Buck and Hare; the manner of finding them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>AS to the Buck, your buſineſs is to take your Meaſures according to the Advantages or Diſadvantages of the place where the Buck is imparked, or in Chaces; and this is more eaſie to be taken than the former: And if you can hunt the Stag well, by the ſame Rules, with leſs Trouble, this may be run down.</p>
                  <p>But what is moſt the honeſt Countryman's Sport, is, the Hare; and therefore I ſhall be large in my Directions upon her, as to the finding and running her down.</p>
                  <p>If you ſeek her in Champion Countries, you muſt beat the moſt likely Buſhes and Covertures; as, Brambles, Brown Graſs or Brakes: And if there be no ſuch Shelter in the beginning of Hunting-time, repair to the Stubble and to the Fallows about <hi>Chriſtmas;</hi> but in <hi>March,</hi> to the Green Corn, which are her moſt likely Hauraes; eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of the largeſt and beſt Hares.</p>
                  <p>There is another Rule to be taken in finding the Hare, and that is, to repair to her former Seat, and obſerve whether it is new or old; if it be plain and ſmooth, and the Pad before it worn and flat, and the Pricks new, eaſie to be ſeen, and the Earth appear black, as if it were juſt broken, then it is new, and ſhe is not gone ſo far from it, but you may expect her to return: But if the Marks ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:174183:81"/>
otherwiſe, then conclude ſhe has left it for a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time; and if the Hounds have taken any Scent, and open, then call them off; for unleſs a Hare acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ſtart, you will loſe your Labour.</p>
                  <p>The Hare has Slights almoſt more than any Creature that is uſed to be hunted; for ſhe will make many Doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and Windings to avoid the Purſuit, which you muſt well note and obſerve, or you may chance to loſe her; therefore you muſt at every Default give your Hounds Scope and ſufficient Leaſure in caſting about their Rings for the Windings of them; and after this, obſerve her Leaps, and the Skips which ſhe makes, before ſhe quats; then with your Pole beat the places where ſhe is moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſhelter; for being reduced to theſe neceſſitous Shifts, ſhe is at her laſt Caſt, and has but a little time to hold out, nor can be long out of your Poſſeſſion. And thus much for all that is material in Hunting the Hare, as far as Directions can be given in Print.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>Of the Fox, Badger, and Wild-Goat.</head>
                  <p>THE taking the Fox, Badger, and Wild-Goat, are other Recreations in ſome places of this Kingdom highly in Eſteem; and there is very good Sport to be found in it, though the Quarreys are of no Value, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept their Skins.</p>
                  <p>As for the Fox, he is a ſubtile cunning Creature, not eaſily to be circumvented; his Reſting-place is generally in the Ground, or ſome hollow Tree, but moſtly in the former; and when once he's unkennel'd, ſtop up the Hole, and caſt in your Fox-dogs, who by reaſon of the ſtrong or burning Scent he leaves behind him, cannot miſs, if once they have taken it, to follow him in the right Track; keep him, if you can, from getting into the Woods; mark his Mocks, Wiles, and Leaps, that ſo you may be the abler to deal with him, though he be a ſtrong one: He will lead you a weary Journey over Plains and Hills before you can run him down; and if he earths, you muſt ſend in your Tarrier after him, if the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:174183:82"/>
Hole be wide enough, or elſe dig him out. His Haunts are ſo uncertain when he is a roaming, that Directions cannot well be given about it; and you may ſooner light on him by chance out of his Hole, than when you go pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to look for him; and that will be by the Dogs hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening to light on the Scent, which is very ſtrong.</p>
                  <p>The Badger is a kind of Wild-dog, living in Ground like the Fox, but not ſo hurtful to Cattel and Poultrey: His Haunts and Coverts are uſually in Woods or buſhy places. The Dogs muſt be hardy and bold that venture on him; for he is ſtrong, and a very ſhrewd Biter; and, for the laſt Refuge, when almoſt run down, haſts to his Hole; but finding it ſtopped, as it muſt be, if you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to take him, he will ſet himſelf againſt it, and fight very couragious, even to Death. He is a Heavy Creature, and by the Unevenneſs of his Legs, as ſome allow it, of no ſwift Flight, and therefore ſoon overtaken in the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit.</p>
                  <p>As for hunting the Wild-Goat, it is much uſed in <hi>Wales</hi> on the Mountains, but a very dangerous Exerciſe to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue among thoſe ſcraggy Rocks. This is a Creature that is not in thoſe ſteep places eaſily taken; for neither Dogs nor Men in ſome places can follow her, where ſhe will run on the ſides of the Rocks like a Cat; ſo that, hallowing and making a noiſe with Horns, they watch at her Bolting-places, or ſteep comings down, and ſo ſieze her with the Dogs; and if it be a young She-Goat, this hunting will render her as tender as Veniſon.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>Of the Otter.</head>
                  <p>THis Otter is a Creature that lives as well by Water as Land, and is a great Devourer of Fiſh. Having ſet her from her Holes in the Banks, if you can keep her on the Land, ſhe is preſently taken; but upon any Fright, if poſſible, ſhe will take the Water, eſpecially being purſued; and if the Dogs be good, they will pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue her there, and dive after her, till ſhe comes to vent, and then her beſt is paſt; for then, if the Water be not
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:174183:82"/>
too deep for Horſes to enter, ſhe may be eaſily ſtruck with an Otter-ſpear, and taken.</p>
                  <p>As to the taking of other Creatures, that are great Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the induſtrious Huſbandman, Farmer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in their Corn, Underwoods, Fiſh-ponds, Rivers, and other things, I, for Brevity's ſake, refer you to my <hi>Vermin-killer,</hi> in my approved Book treating of <hi>Domeſtick Cattle,</hi> and many other profitable things.</p>

               <p>IT is a Sign of Hail when the Sky is ſuddenly overcaſt and there is a noiſe of ruſhing heard in the Air, cauſed by the Vapours of contrary quality being cloſed in the Clouds, which ſtrive to break and ſhiver into Particles the ponderous Body of congealed Vapours preſſing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Earth, which is its proper Center: And as the Cold is greater or leſſer, ſo are the Hail-ſtones: And this moſtly happens in the Spring and Summer, becauſe the Vapour is more forcibly ſent up; ſo that reaching the cold Region, it is frozen there; which in VVinter, the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours being thinner or flagging, do not, and therefore are convertible into Driſle or Snow.</p>

                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:174183:88"/>Again, there are ſome that prick out of the whole Year ſix moſt unfortunate Days above all other, wherein they adviſe no Man for to bleed, or take any Drink, becauſe the Effects of the Conſtellations work mightily to Death; and in other Reſpects, that they might be unfortunate. They are, <hi>January</hi> the 3d, <hi>April</hi> the 30th, <hi>July</hi> the 1ſt, <hi>August</hi> the 1ſt, <hi>October</hi> the 2d, and <hi>December</hi> the 31ſt.</p>
               <p>Moreover, there are certain unfortunate Days in the Year, call'd <hi>Dog-Days,</hi> which are accounted very prejudicial to Health: They begin the 19th of <hi>July,</hi> and end the 27th of <hi>August;</hi> the Malignity of which Days <hi>Pliny</hi> diſcourſeth of, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 40. in his Natural Hiſtory.

               <p>There are other ſhort Obſervations for each Month in the Year, which I have thought fit to affix, though of different Effects. If the Sun ſhine the 12th of <hi>January,</hi> there ſhall be ſtore of Wind that Year. If it thunders upon <hi>Shrove-Tueſday</hi> in <hi>February,</hi> it ſignifieth Wind, ſtore of Fruit, and Plenty, the Sun-beams being early abroad; and ſo much as he ſhineth that Day, he will ſhine in the ſame manner every Day in <hi>Lent.</hi> So many Miſts as there be in <hi>March,</hi> ſo many hoary Froſts will be after <hi>Eaſter.</hi> If it rain on the <hi>Aſcenſion-day,</hi> (which moſt commonly falleth in <hi>April</hi>) it doth betoken Scarcity of all kind of Food for Cattel; but being fair, it ſignifieth Plenty. If the Sun ſhine upon the 25th of <hi>May,</hi> Wine will proſper well: Alſo in the End of <hi>May,</hi> if Oaks begin to bear Bloſſoms, it doth foreſhew much Tallow and Fruit. If it rain the 24th of <hi>June,</hi> Hazel-nuts will not thrive. If it be fair three Sundays before St. <hi>James</hi>'s-day, Corn will be good. If the Wind change upon St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi>-day at Night, the following Year will not be fruitful. In <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> ſo many Days old as the Moon is on <hi>Michaelmas</hi>-day, ſo many Floods will be that Winter. In <hi>October,</hi> if Leaves hang on the Trees, it portends a cold Winter, and many Caterpillars. <hi>November</hi> 10th, if on that Day the Heavens are cloudy, it prognoſticates a wet Winter. If

                  <hi>Chriſtmas</hi>-day come in the New of the Moon, it is a Sign of a good Year; and ſo much the better, by how much it is nearer the New Moon; the contrary happeneth it its Decreaſe.</p>
               <p>I have inſerted theſe laſt Obſervations, rather to pleaſe ſome conceited old People, rather than any ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to give any certain Credence to them; nor ſhall they want their old Story of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Day:

               <p>THE Wind is an Exhalation hot and dry, ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in the hollow Concavities of the Earth, which breaking forth, moveth the ſide-ways upon the Earth, of which formerly was known but Twelve, but now Thirty Two, as may be ſeen by the Mariners Compaſs, of which we ſhall not need to diſcourſe.

Now the Cauſe why it bloweth more ſharply at one time than another, and at ſome times not at all, is according to the Fumes that ariſe out of new Exhalations out of Floods, Fens, and Ma ſhes, which augments his Force, the Defect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may either allay or increaſe it. Likewiſe Mountains, Hills, and Woods, (by reaſon of the Earth's Rotundity) may hinder its Force from blowing in all places equally; whereas upon the plain and broad Sea it bloweth with an equal Force; concerning the ceaſing thereof divers Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons might be aſſigned; as, the Froſt congealing the Pores of the Earth, from whence it ſhould iſſue; or the Sun drying up the Fumes and Vapours that ſhould increaſe it.</p>
